    # rsa 0.9.10 - Marvin Attack timing sidechannel (medium severity)
    # - No fix available in dependency chain (comes from LanceDB → opendal → reqsign → rsa)
    # - Waiting for upstream fix: https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA/issues/19
    # - Impact: Potential key recovery through timing sidechannels
    # - Mitigation: Not directly exposed in Caro's API surface
