# Kibble Friction Log
# Track suboptimal command generations for continuous improvement
#
# Usage: Add entries when Caro generates a command that is:
#   - Incorrect (wrong command entirely)
#   - Suboptimal (works but not the best approach)
#   - Missing flags (e.g., missing -h for human-readable)
#   - Wrong syntax for platform (BSD vs GNU)
#
# Severity levels:
#   - critical: Command would cause harm or data loss
#   - major: Command doesn't work at all
#   - minor: Command works but suboptimal
#   - trivial: Cosmetic or preference issues
