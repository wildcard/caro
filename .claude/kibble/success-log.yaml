# Kibble Success Log
# Track excellent command generations for pattern harvesting
#
# Usage: Add entries when Caro generates a command that is:
#   - Exactly right on first try
#   - Better than what you would have typed
#   - Demonstrates good platform/shell awareness
#   - Handles edge cases well
#
# Quality levels:
#   - excellent: Perfect command, consider for documentation
#   - good: Correct and efficient
#   - acceptable: Works but could be slightly better
