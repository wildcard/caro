# QA Known Flakes

Document flaky behaviours observed during QA runs. A flake observed 3+ times in 7 days should be reclassified as a regression and filed as a GitHub issue.

### FLAKE-001: Model download failure in remote sandbox

**First observed**: 2026-05-07  
**Symptom**: `caro -p "..." --dry-run` fails with `Backend is not available: Failed to download model after 3 attempts` after 3 retries (2s, 4s backoff).  
**Context**: Remote CI/QA sandbox where `https://huggingface.co/` returns HTTP 200 but binary blob downloads time out or are blocked at a lower network layer. Proxy (`http://127.0.0.1:39747`) is detected by `caro doctor` but does not help for binary downloads.  
**Impact**: Slot A `--dry-run` smoke check cannot be completed in this environment. Use `caro --version`, `--help`, and `doctor` as proxy for binary health; use `cargo test --lib` for functional coverage.  
**Occurrence log**:
- 2026-05-07: observed once (bootstrap pass)
- 2026-08-01: reproduced (second observation; 85-day gap, not within 7-day promotion window)

**Promotion threshold**: File regression issue if observed 3 times in 7 days OR if it reproduces on a known-good environment with a pre-downloaded model.  
**Workaround**: Run `caro -p "..." --dry-run` from an environment with `~/.cache/caro/models/` pre-populated, or with Ollama installed as fallback backend.
