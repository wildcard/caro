[25~Okay, so all of the alternative high-value options are great, but let's push them to another milestone, maybe 1.2 instead of 1.1. The important task that we were talking about, the 135, is super, super critical! What I'm interested in doing at that point is that we take it in a work tree and we do an extensive work on this specific issue using using spec kitty.

So basically, spec kitty can create the work tree even here, so it's simplifying the process. You will always answer back to spec kitty the programmatic answers to spec kitty process this spec kitty question. We will answer pragmatic, we will ask select pragmatic answers that are based on our prior research and the issue, and all the information that we gathered in this release.

So you can look at the information that is collected in the release directory under Claude. After you are done with this with creating the evaluation harness which is super critical, then you can take any of the upcoming issues.

Everyone welcome to this course! We're so happy to have you here and we thank you so much for putting your trust in us that are that are still that are still part of version 1.1.
