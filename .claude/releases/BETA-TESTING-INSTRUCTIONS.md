### First Run

On first run, you'll see a telemetry notice:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊  Telemetry & Privacy
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Caro is in beta and collects anonymous usage data to improve the product.

We collect:
  ✓ Session timing and performance metrics
  ✓ Platform info (OS, shell type)
  ✓ Error categories and safety events

We NEVER collect:
  ✗ Your commands or natural language input
  ✗ File paths or environment variables
  ✗ Any personally identifiable information

Learn more: https://caro.sh/telemetry
You can disable telemetry anytime with:
  caro config set telemetry.enabled false

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Telemetry Default**: Enabled for beta testing (helps us improve quality)
**To Disable**: Run `caro config set telemetry.enabled false`

**Telemetry Management**: Use `caro telemetry status` to check current telemetry settings and see what data is queued for upload.

- [ ] `caro --version` shows `1.1.0-beta.1`
- [ ] `caro --help` displays help message
- [ ] First-run telemetry notice appeared
- [ ] No errors during installation

**Basic Command Generation**:
- [ ] `caro "list files"` → Should generate `ls -la` or similar
- [ ] `caro "show disk usage"` → Should generate `df -h` or similar
- [ ] `caro "find large files"` → Should generate find command
- [ ] `caro "show running processes"` → Should generate `ps` command
- [ ] Commands execute successfully when you run them

**System Assessment**:
- [ ] `caro assess` → Shows hardware details (CPU, GPU, RAM)
- [ ] Provides model recommendations based on hardware

caro doctor
```
- [ ] Shows platform detection (OS, architecture)

caro config set telemetry.enabled false
```

**Test Checklist**:
- [ ] `caro telemetry status` shows current configuration
- [ ] `caro telemetry show` displays collected events
- [ ] Events contain no PII (commands, paths, usernames)
- [ ] After disabling, status shows "DISABLED"

### Day 2-3: Daily Workflow Integration

**Use caro for your real work**. Try these categories:

**File Management**:
- [ ] `caro "find files modified today"`
- [ ] `caro "files larger than 100MB"`
- [ ] `caro "show disk space by directory"`
- [ ] `caro "find python files from last week"`

**Track Your Usage**:
- Keep notes on commands that worked well
- Keep notes on commands that failed or were wrong
- Note any commands that felt "close but not quite right"
- Track how often you used caro vs typing commands manually

### Day 4: Safety Validation Testing

**Test Safety Features** (commands should be BLOCKED):

```bash
# These should trigger safety warnings:
caro "delete everything"
caro "remove all files recursively"
caro "chmod 777 everything"
caro "kill all processes"
caro "format disk"
caro "drop database"
```

**Safety Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Dangerous deletion commands are blocked
- [ ] Recursive operations trigger warnings
- [ ] System-wide changes are flagged
- [ ] You can still execute after confirmation (if needed)
- [ ] NO false positives on safe commands

**Safe Commands Should Pass** (should NOT be blocked):
```bash
caro "list files"
caro "show disk usage"
caro "find log files"
caro "search for pattern"
```

### Day 5: Edge Cases & Final Testing

**Edge Case Testing**:
- [ ] Very long queries (50+ words)
- [ ] Queries with special characters: `!@#$%^&*()`
- [ ] Queries with file paths: `/path/to/file.txt`
- [ ] Queries with numbers: `100MB`, `5 days`, `10 files`
- [ ] Multi-part queries: "find files AND do something"
- [ ] Ambiguous queries: "show info" (what info?)
- [ ] Empty query: `caro ""`
- [ ] Non-English characters (if applicable)

**Platform-Specific Testing**:
- [ ] macOS: BSD command variants work correctly
- [ ] Linux: GNU command variants work correctly
- [ ] Shell-specific features (if using zsh/bash/fish)

**Performance Testing**:
- [ ] Commands generate in <1 second
- [ ] No noticeable slowdown in terminal
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable (`top` or Activity Monitor)
- [ ] No crashes or hangs

**Final Checks**:
- [ ] Run `caro telemetry show` to review collected events
- [ ] Verify no PII (commands, paths, env vars) in telemetry
- [ ] Note overall satisfaction (1-5 scale)
- [ ] List top 3 bugs or issues
- [ ] List top 3 feature requests

> **Note**: Telemetry export is not available in beta.1. Privacy verification will be done in future beta iterations.

---

## 🔍 Privacy Review

At the end of your testing period, review what data was collected:

```bash
# View telemetry events
caro telemetry show

# Check telemetry status
caro telemetry status
```

**What to Check**:
- ✅ No command text or natural language queries
- ✅ No file paths or directory names
- ✅ No environment variables
- ✅ No usernames or system-specific identifiers
- ✅ Only anonymous performance/error metrics

### Privacy Guarantees (For Reference)

Even though you cannot review telemetry exports in beta.1, caro's privacy guarantees are:

**What is NEVER collected**:
- Your actual commands or natural language queries
- File paths or directory names
- Email addresses or usernames
- IP addresses
- Environment variables
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

**What IS collected** (when telemetry is enabled):
- Session IDs (anonymous hashes)
- Platform info (OS type, shell type)
- Performance metrics (timing)
- Error categories (generic error types)
- Backend usage (static vs LLM)

**If you find PII**:
1. STOP using caro immediately
2. File a CRITICAL bug on GitHub
3. Email privacy@caro.sh
4. Include the specific PII found (redacted)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**"caro: command not found"**:
```bash
# Check if in PATH
which caro

# If not, add to PATH
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**"Permission denied"**:
```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/caro
```

**Version shows wrong number**:
```bash
# Remove old version
which caro
sudo rm $(which caro)

# Reinstall beta
```

### Runtime Issues

**Commands not generating**:
```bash
# Check health diagnostics
caro doctor

# Check verbose output
RUST_LOG=debug caro "your query"
```

**Slow performance**:
```bash
# Check backend being used
caro assess

# Try static matcher only
caro --backend static "your query"
```

**Crashes or hangs**:
```bash
# Run with backtrace
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 caro "your query"

# Report crash on GitHub with backtrace
```
