# Accessibility and Inclusive Design Guide - v1.1.0-beta

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-08
**Status**: Pre-Launch
**Owner**: Product Lead / Accessibility Champion

---

## Overview

This document establishes accessibility standards and inclusive design principles for the Caro project, ensuring the CLI tool and all documentation are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.

### Goals

- **Universal Access**: Ensure Caro is usable by people of all abilities
- **Inclusive Documentation**: Make all documentation accessible
- **Assistive Technology Compatibility**: Work with screen readers and other tools
- **Compliance**: Meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (where applicable)

---

## Accessibility Principles

### 1. Perceivable

**Users must be able to perceive the information being presented**

**CLI Context**:
- Clear, descriptive text output
- No reliance on color alone for meaning
- Support for terminal color schemes (light/dark mode)
- Text-based output (no ASCII art as primary interface)

---

### 2. Operable

**Users must be able to operate the interface**

**CLI Context**:
- Keyboard-only operation (no mouse required - CLI is naturally keyboard-based)
- Reasonable time limits (no auto-advancing prompts)
- Clear navigation (command structure, help text)
- No flashing content (avoid rapid animations)

---

### 3. Understandable

**Users must be able to understand the information and operation**

**CLI Context**:
- Clear, simple language (no jargon without explanation)
- Consistent command structure
- Helpful error messages
- Predictable behavior

---

### 4. Robust

**Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by assistive technologies**

**CLI Context**:
- Standard text output (not binary or proprietary format)
- Compatible with screen readers
- Works with terminal multiplexers (tmux, screen)
- Proper exit codes for scripting

---

## CLI Accessibility Features

### Text Output

**Clear and Descriptive**:

```bash
# ✅ GOOD: Descriptive output
$ caro "list files"
Generated command: ls -la
Description: List all files in the current directory including hidden files
Execute? (y/n):

# ❌ BAD: Cryptic output
$ caro "list files"
ls -la
y/n?
```

---

**No Color Dependency**:

```rust
// ✅ GOOD: Color is additive, not required
println!("✅ {}", "Success".green()); // Shows "✅ Success" (green on color terminals)
// On terminals without color: "✅ Success" (still readable)

// ❌ BAD: Relies on color alone
println!("{}", "Success".green()); // Color-only indicator
```

---

**Respect Terminal Settings**:

```rust
use supports_color::on;

fn print_status(msg: &str) {
    if on(supports_color::Stream::Stdout).is_some() {
        // Terminal supports color
        println!("{}", msg.green());
    } else {
        // No color support, use symbols
        println!("✓ {}", msg);
    }
}
```

---

### Screen Reader Compatibility

**Text-Based Output**:

```bash
# ✅ GOOD: Plain text, screen reader friendly
Command generated successfully.
Generated command: find . -name "*.rs"
This will find all Rust files in the current directory.
Execute? (y/n):

# ❌ BAD: ASCII art table (screen reader reads character by character)
┌─────────────────┐
│ Command         │
├─────────────────┤
│ find . -name... │
└─────────────────┘
```

---

**Progress Indicators**:

```rust
// ✅ GOOD: Text-based progress
println!("Loading model... (this may take 30 seconds)");
println!("Loading model... 25%");
println!("Loading model... 50%");
println!("Loading model... 100%");
println!("Model loaded successfully.");

// ❌ BAD: Spinner only (no text updates)
// [spinner animation] (screen reader doesn't announce progress)
```

---

### Error Messages

**Clear and Actionable**:

```bash
# ✅ GOOD: Descriptive error with solution
Error: Installation failed - curl not found

Caro requires curl to download the binary.

To fix:
  macOS: Install Xcode Command Line Tools
    $ xcode-select --install

  Linux: Install curl
    $ sudo apt install curl  (Ubuntu/Debian)
    $ sudo dnf install curl  (Fedora)

After installing, please re-run the installation script.

# ❌ BAD: Cryptic error
Error: ENOENT
```

---

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**All features keyboard-accessible**:

```bash
# Prompts use standard keyboard input
Execute? (y/n): y        # Press y, then Enter
Execute? (y/n): n        # Press n, then Enter

# No mouse-only features
# No keyboard shortcuts that conflict with terminal emulators (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z)
```

---

## Documentation Accessibility

### README.md and Docs

**Structure and Headings**:

```markdown
# Caro - Natural Language Shell Commands

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### macOS
[Content...]

#### Linux
[Content...]

## Usage

### Basic Commands
[Content...]

# ✅ GOOD: Hierarchical headings (h1 → h2 → h3)
# Screen readers can navigate by heading level
```

---

**Alternative Text for Images**:

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Descriptive alt text
![Caro generating a command from the query "list files", showing the generated command "ls -la" and prompting the user to execute it](screenshots/demo.gif)

# ❌ BAD: No alt text
![](screenshots/demo.gif)

# ❌ BAD: Generic alt text
![screenshot](screenshots/demo.gif)
```

---

**Link Text**:

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Descriptive link text
See the [installation guide](docs/INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions.
Learn more about [command safety validation](docs/SAFETY.md).

# ❌ BAD: Non-descriptive link text
Click [here](docs/INSTALL.md) for installation.
[Link](docs/SAFETY.md)
```

---

**Code Examples**:

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Context before code
To install Caro on macOS, run the following command:
\```bash
curl -sSL https://caro-cli.dev/install.sh | sh
\```

# ❌ BAD: Code without context
\```bash
curl -sSL https://caro-cli.dev/install.sh | sh
\```
```

---

**Lists**:

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Semantic lists
Caro supports the following platforms:
- macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Linux (x86_64 and ARM64)
- Windows (via WSL2)

# ❌ BAD: Non-semantic lists (using dashes in plain text)
Caro supports:
- macOS
- Linux
- Windows
(Screen reader may not recognize as a list)
```

---

### Video Content

**Captions and Transcripts**:

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Video with transcript
[Video: Caro Installation Tutorial (5 minutes)]

**Transcript**:
"In this tutorial, we'll install Caro on macOS.
First, open your terminal by pressing Cmd+Space and typing 'Terminal'.
Next, run the following command: curl -sSL..."

# Alternative: YouTube auto-captions (enable closed captions)
```

---

## Inclusive Language

### Gender-Neutral Language

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Gender-neutral
When a user runs Caro, they will see...
The developer can customize their experience...

# ❌ BAD: Gendered
When a user runs Caro, he will see...
The developer can customize his experience...
```

---

### Ability-Neutral Language

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Ability-neutral
Caro is designed for everyone
This feature is available to all users

# ❌ BAD: Ability-focused
Caro is designed for normal users
This feature requires you to see the screen
```

---

### Avoiding Jargon

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Explained jargon
Caro uses a static matcher (a pattern-matching system that recognizes common queries)
for fast command generation.

# ❌ BAD: Unexplained jargon
Caro uses a deterministic FSM for lexical analysis of NL queries.
```

---

## Color and Contrast

### Terminal Color Support

**Check Terminal Capabilities**:

```rust
use supports_color::on;

pub fn colored_output_available() -> bool {
    on(supports_color::Stream::Stdout).is_some()
}

// Use color only if supported
if colored_output_available() {
    println!("{}", "Success".green());
} else {
    println!("✓ Success");
}
```

---

**Color Palette** (for terminals that support color):

| Use Case | Color | WCAG Contrast Ratio | Notes |
|----------|-------|---------------------|-------|
| **Success** | Green (#00A000) | 4.5:1 on black | ✅ AA compliant |
| **Error** | Red (#E00000) | 4.5:1 on black | ✅ AA compliant |
| **Warning** | Yellow (#FFD000) | 4.5:1 on black | ✅ AA compliant |
| **Info** | Blue (#0080FF) | 4.5:1 on black | ✅ AA compliant |

---

**Avoid Color-Only Indicators**:

```bash
# ✅ GOOD: Symbol + color
✓ Test passed (green text)
✗ Test failed (red text)

# ❌ BAD: Color only
passed (green text with no symbol)
failed (red text with no symbol)
```

---

## Cognitive Accessibility

### Clear Language

**Simple Sentences**:

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Short, clear sentences
Caro generates shell commands from natural language.
It runs locally on your machine.
No cloud API required.

# ❌ BAD: Complex sentence
Caro, which is a CLI tool that leverages local LLMs for generating shell commands
based on natural language input provided by the user, operates entirely on the
user's local machine without requiring any cloud-based API calls or internet connectivity.
```

---

**Bullet Points Over Paragraphs**:

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Scannable bullet points
Caro features:
- 100% local (no cloud)
- Fast (<50ms for common commands)
- Safe (blocks dangerous commands)
- Cross-platform (macOS, Linux)

# ❌ BAD: Dense paragraph
Caro is a 100% local tool that doesn't require cloud connectivity and generates
commands in under 50ms for common queries while also providing safety validation
to block dangerous commands and supporting both macOS and Linux platforms.
```

---

### Consistent Terminology

**Use Same Terms**:

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Consistent
- Installation (always "installation")
- Command generation (always "command generation")
- Static matcher (always "static matcher")

# ❌ BAD: Inconsistent
- Installation / Setup / Getting started
- Command generation / Command creation / Query processing
- Static matcher / Pattern matcher / Rule engine
```

---

### Progressive Disclosure

**Start Simple, Add Detail Gradually**:

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Progressive disclosure

## Quick Start (Level 1 - Beginner)
Install Caro and generate your first command:
\```bash
caro "list files"
\```

## Usage (Level 2 - Intermediate)
Caro supports various query types:
- File management: "find large files"
- System monitoring: "show CPU usage"
[More examples...]

## Advanced (Level 3 - Expert)
Configure Caro with custom backends:
[Detailed configuration...]
```

---

## Testing Accessibility

### Manual Testing

**Screen Reader Testing**:

**macOS**:
1. Enable VoiceOver: `Cmd + F5`
2. Run Caro commands
3. Verify all output is read correctly
4. Check error messages are clear

**Linux**:
1. Install Orca screen reader: `sudo apt install orca`
2. Run Orca: `orca`
3. Test Caro commands
4. Verify output is accessible

---

**Keyboard-Only Testing**:

1. Disconnect mouse
2. Run Caro commands using keyboard only
3. Verify all features work (prompts, menus)
4. Check no mouse-only features

---

**Color Blindness Simulation**:

```bash
# Test with no color support
NO_COLOR=1 caro "list files"

# Test with limited color palette
TERM=xterm-16color caro "list files"

# Verify symbols still convey meaning without color
```

---

### Automated Testing

**CI/CD Checks**:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/accessibility.yml
name: Accessibility Check

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Check documentation for accessibility issues
      - name: Check markdown for alt text
        run: |
          # Ensure all images have alt text
          grep -r '!\[\](' docs/ && echo "Images missing alt text!" && exit 1 || echo "All images have alt text"

      # Check for proper heading hierarchy
      - name: Check heading structure
        run: |
          pip install mdformat
          mdformat --check docs/

      # Check for color-only indicators in code
      - name: Check for color-only output
        run: |
          # Ensure color output has symbol fallback
          grep -r "\.green()" src/ | grep -v "✓\|✅" && echo "Color without symbol!" && exit 1 || echo "Color with symbols"
```
