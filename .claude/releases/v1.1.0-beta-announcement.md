**Date**: January 24, 2026
**Type**: Beta Release
**Focus**: Privacy-First Telemetry + Command Generation Quality

---

## 🎉 Announcing Caro v1.1.0-beta

We're excited to announce the beta release of Caro v1.1.0, bringing privacy-first telemetry and significantly improved command generation quality to help us build a better product together!

### What's New

#### Privacy-First Telemetry System

Caro now includes an **optional telemetry system** that helps us improve the product while **protecting your privacy**.

**What We Collect** (Metadata Only):
- ✅ Session timing and performance metrics
- ✅ Platform info (OS, shell type)
- ✅ Backend usage patterns
- ✅ Error categories and safety events

**What We DON'T Collect** (Zero PII):
- ❌ Your commands or natural language input
- ❌ File paths or directory structures
- ❌ Email addresses or IP addresses
- ❌ Environment variables or API keys
- ❌ Any personally identifiable information

**Privacy Guarantees**:
- Multi-layer validation prevents accidental PII leakage
- Anonymous session IDs (hashed + daily rotation)
- Full control via CLI: `caro telemetry show/export/clear/disable`
- Air-gapped mode for offline environments

👉 Read our complete [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/wildcard/caro/blob/main/docs/TELEMETRY.md)

#### Improved Command Generation Quality

**94.8% pass rate** on our comprehensive test suite! 🎯

We've significantly enhanced command generation through improved static pattern matching:

**What's Better**:
- ✅ Natural language variants: "files changed today", "disk space by folder"
- ✅ Edge cases handled: "files modified yesterday", "large JS files over 50MB"
- ✅ Compound queries: file extension + time/size filters work correctly
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility: Better macOS/Linux command detection

**Quality Metrics**:
- Static matcher: 100% pass rate in 7/8 categories
- Performance: 0.002ms telemetry overhead (2500x better than target!)
- Privacy audit: PASSED - Zero PII collection verified
- 220+ tests passing

4. **Share feedback**: Fill out our [Beta Feedback Form](https://github.com/wildcard/caro/discussions/XXX)

### What We're Testing

- **Telemetry Privacy**: Verify zero PII in collected data
- **Command Quality**: Real-world command generation success rate
- **Performance**: Startup time, generation latency, resource usage
- **User Experience**: Installation, first-run, CLI commands, error messages

### Beta Timeline

- **Jan 24**: Beta release launch
- **Jan 24-31**: Beta testing period

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

We take privacy and security seriously:

### Privacy Protections
- ✅ **Zero PII collection**: Validated through comprehensive privacy audit
- ✅ **Multi-layer validation**: Type system + dual regex validation
- ✅ **Anonymous session IDs**: Hashed machine ID + daily rotation
- ✅ **User control**: Full transparency via CLI commands
- ✅ **Air-gapped mode**: Export/import for offline environments

### Security Measures
- ✅ **Safety validation**: Dangerous command detection and blocking
- ✅ **No arbitrary code execution**: Commands validated before generation
- ✅ **Transparent operation**: Clear output, no hidden actions
- ✅ **Open source**: Full codebase available for inspection
