```

---

### Q: What platforms are supported?

**A**:
- ✅ **macOS** (Apple Silicon and Intel)
- ✅ **Linux** (x86_64 and ARM64)
- ❌ Windows (not yet supported, planned for v1.2.0)
- ❌ BSD (community contributions welcome)

---

### Q: What are the system requirements?

**A**:
- **OS**: macOS 10.15+ or Linux kernel 4.4+
- **Memory**: 50MB RAM (minimal overhead)
- **Disk**: 20MB for binary + 5MB for telemetry database
- **Shell**: bash, zsh, fish, or any POSIX-compatible shell

---

### Q: Do I need an API key or account?

**A**: No! Caro works completely offline using local models. No API keys, accounts, or internet connection required (except for initial installation).

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Telemetry

### Q: What data does Caro collect?

**A**: Only **anonymous metadata**, never your commands or personal information:

**✅ We collect**:
- Session timing (duration, timestamps)
- Command generation success/failure
- Platform info (OS, architecture, shell type)
- Performance metrics (generation time)
- Backend used (static matcher vs LLM)

**❌ We NEVER collect**:
- Your natural language input or generated commands
- File paths or directory structures
- Email addresses, usernames, or IP addresses
- Environment variables or API keys
- Hostnames (session IDs are hashed daily)

[Read full Privacy Policy](https://github.com/wildcard/caro/blob/main/docs/TELEMETRY.md)

---

### Q: Can I disable telemetry?

**A**: Yes! Multiple ways:

```bash
# Option 1: Disable in config
caro config set telemetry.enabled false

# Option 2: CLI flag (per-command)
caro --no-telemetry "find large files"

# Option 3: Environment variable
export CARO_TELEMETRY=false

# Option 4: Delete telemetry database
rm ~/.local/share/caro/telemetry.db
```

---

### Q: Can I see what data is collected before it's sent?

**A**: Absolutely! Caro is designed for **air-gapped environments** and full transparency:

```bash
# View all collected events
caro telemetry show

# Export to JSON for inspection
caro telemetry export my-data.json

# Clear all local data
caro telemetry clear
```

You can inspect every single event before sharing. Nothing is sent without your knowledge.

---

### Q: Is my data sold or shared with third parties?

**A**: **Never.** We don't sell data, period. Telemetry is used solely for:
1. Understanding usage patterns
2. Improving command generation quality
3. Prioritizing features

All data is deleted by **February 15, 2026** after analysis is complete.

---

### Q: Why opt-out instead of opt-in?

**A**: We need sufficient data to make informed product decisions. With opt-in telemetry, typically <5% of users participate, which isn't statistically meaningful.

However, we've built the most privacy-respecting opt-out system possible:
- Clear first-run disclosure
- Zero PII collection (verified by audit)
- Full transparency (inspect all data)
- Easy to disable (multiple methods)
- Automatic deletion (Feb 15, 2026)

If you're uncomfortable, disabling is simple and we respect that choice.

---

## 🎯 Features & Usage

### Q: What's new in v1.1.0-beta?

**A**: Two major additions:

1. **Privacy-First Telemetry System**:
   - Collect anonymous usage data to improve Caro
   - Full transparency and user control
   - Zero PII guarantee

2. **Improved Command Generation Quality**:
   - 94.8% pass rate on our comprehensive test suite
   - Expanded static pattern matcher (deterministic, reliable)

---

### Q: How good is command generation quality?

**A**: In our comprehensive testing (58 test cases across 8 categories):
- **Overall**: 94.8% pass rate
- **File management**: 100% (19/19)
- **System monitoring**: 100% (7/7)
- **Network operations**: 100% (5/5)
- **DevOps/Kubernetes**: 100% (5/5)

However, beta testing will reveal real-world performance. We're collecting data to improve further.

---

### Q: Does it work offline?

**A**: Yes! Caro uses local models (embedded in the binary or via MLX on Apple Silicon). No internet connection required after installation.

---

### Q: What commands can Caro generate?

**A**: Caro specializes in common command-line tasks:

**Supported Categories**:
- File operations (find, ls, du, stat)
- System monitoring (ps, top, lsof, df)
- Text processing (grep, sed, awk, cut)
- Git operations (status, log, diff, branch)
- Network diagnostics (ping, curl, netstat, ss)
- DevOps tools (docker, kubectl)
- Process management (kill, pkill, nice)

**Not Supported Yet**:
- Complex multi-line scripts
- Interactive commands (vim, nano)
- GUI applications
- Platform-specific tools (macOS-only or Linux-only)

---

### Q: Can I use Caro for dangerous operations?

**A**: Caro has built-in **safety validation** that warns you before executing potentially dangerous commands:

**Blocked by default**:
- `rm -rf /` (delete root)
- `chmod -R 777 /` (recursive permission changes)
- `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda` (disk wipes)
- `kill -9 $(ps aux | ...)` (mass process kills)

You'll see a warning and must explicitly confirm before Caro generates these commands.

---

## 🧪 Beta Testing

### Q: What is a beta release?

**A**: A beta release is a pre-production version used for:
- Testing new features with real users
- Collecting feedback to improve the product
- Identifying bugs before wider release

Beta releases are generally stable but may have rough edges. We're specifically testing the telemetry system.

---

### Q: Can I participate in beta testing?

**A**: Beta testing recruitment happened **January 10-12, 2026** and we selected 3-5 testers. If you missed it, you can:
- Use the public beta release (January 24, 2026)
- Provide feedback via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wildcard/caro/discussions)
- Report bugs via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/wildcard/caro/issues)
- Participate in future beta tests (v1.1.1, v1.2.0, etc.)

---

### Q: When will v1.1.0 GA (stable) be released?

**A**: Target date is **February 15, 2026**, assuming beta testing goes well. The GA release will include:
- Bug fixes from beta feedback
- Telemetry backend deployment (automatic uploads)
- Improved documentation based on community questions

---

### Q: Should I use the beta in production?

**A**: Beta releases are generally stable, but we recommend:
- ✅ **Use for personal projects** and experimentation
- ✅ **Test in staging environments**
- ⚠️ **Be cautious in production** (no guarantees yet)
- ❌ **Don't rely on for critical systems** (wait for GA)

If you encounter issues, please report them!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Q: Installation fails with "permission denied"

**A**: The install script needs write access to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
# Option 1: Use sudo (if you trust the script)
curl -fsSL https://caro.sh/install.sh | sudo sh

# Option 2: Install to user directory
cargo install caro@1.1.0-beta
# Add ~/.cargo/bin to your PATH

# Option 3: Download binary manually
wget https://github.com/wildcard/caro/releases/download/v1.1.0-beta/caro-macos-aarch64
chmod +x caro-macos-aarch64
mv caro-macos-aarch64 ~/bin/caro
```

---

### Q: Command generation is slow (>5 seconds)

**A**: This is usually expected for complex queries using the LLM fallback. To improve:

1. **Use simpler, more direct queries**:
   - ❌ "I need to find files that were modified in the last week and are larger than 10MB"
   - ✅ "find files modified last week larger than 10MB"

2. **Check which backend is used**:
   ```bash
   caro telemetry show | grep backend_used
   ```
   - `static`: Fast (<100ms), deterministic
   - `embedded`: Slower (1-5s), more flexible

3. **Wait for performance improvements** in v1.1.1

---

### Q: Caro generated an incorrect command

**A**: Please report it! We want to fix these issues:

1. **Don't execute the incorrect command**
2. **Report the issue** on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/wildcard/caro/issues) with:
   - Your natural language query
   - The incorrect command generated
   - What you expected instead
   - Your platform (`uname -a`)
   - Caro version (`caro --version`)

3. **Optional**: Export telemetry for context
   ```bash
   caro telemetry export bug-report.json
   ```
   (Review for PII before sharing)

---

### Q: Telemetry commands aren't working

**A**: Check the database exists:

```bash
# Check if database exists
ls -lh ~/.local/share/caro/telemetry.db

# If missing, create it (automatic on first command generation)
caro "list files"

# Try telemetry commands again
caro telemetry show
```

If still broken, please file an issue with:
```bash
caro --version
uname -a
ls -la ~/.local/share/caro/
```

---

### Q: I found a bug. How do I report it?

**A**: Thank you! Please file an issue on GitHub:

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/wildcard/caro/issues/new
2. **Use the bug report template**
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the bug
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - `caro --version` output
   - Platform: `uname -a`
   - Optional: telemetry export (review for PII first)
