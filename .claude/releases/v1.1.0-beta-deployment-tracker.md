## 🛠️ Phase 1: Pre-Flight Preparation (Current Phase)

### 1.1 Binary Builds [BLOCKING]

**Objective**: Build and verify binaries for beta distribution

**Platforms Needed**:
- [ ] macOS Apple Silicon (aarch64)
- [ ] macOS Intel (x86_64)
- [ ] Linux x86_64
- [ ] Linux ARM64 (optional)

**Build Requirements**:
- Version must show: `caro 1.1.0-beta` (NOT `1.1.0`)
- Binary size: 15-25MB expected
- All tests passing before build
- SHA256 checksums documented

**Action Items**:
```bash
# 1. Verify version includes beta suffix
grep '^version' Cargo.toml

# 2. Update version if needed to include beta marker
# Consider: version = "1.1.0-beta.1"

# 3. Build release binaries
cargo build --release

# 4. Test binary
./target/release/caro --version
# Should show: caro 1.1.0-beta

# 5. Generate checksums
shasum -a 256 target/release/caro > caro-macos-aarch64.sha256
```

**Output**: Binaries ready for beta distribution

---

### 1.2 Beta Flag Verification [HIGH PRIORITY]

**Objective**: Ensure this is clearly marked as BETA everywhere

**Check List**:
- [ ] Version string includes "beta": `1.1.0-beta`
- [ ] `--version` output shows beta marker
- [ ] First-run notice mentions beta status
- [ ] README.md clearly states beta
- [ ] GitHub release marked as "Pre-release"
- [ ] Installation scripts warn about beta

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Verify beta marker in version
./target/release/caro --version | grep -i beta

# Check help text
./target/release/caro --help | head -5

# Verify first-run experience mentions beta
rm -rf ~/.config/caro  # Clean slate
./target/release/caro "test" | grep -i beta
```

**Output**: Beta status visible to all users

---

### 1.3 Installation Methods [BLOCKING]

**Objective**: Prepare installation for beta testers

**Methods to Support**:

**A. Direct Binary Download**:
```bash
# Example for macOS Apple Silicon beta tester
curl -L https://github.com/wildcard/caro/releases/download/v1.1.0-beta/caro-macos-aarch64 -o caro
chmod +x caro
./caro --version
```

**B. Install Script** (if available):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://caro.sh/install-beta.sh | sh
```
- [ ] Script detects platform
- [ ] Script installs beta version
- [ ] Script shows beta warning

**C. Cargo Install** (for developers):
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/wildcard/caro --tag v1.1.0-beta
```

**D. Build from Source**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wildcard/caro
cd caro
git checkout v1.1.0-beta
cargo build --release
./target/release/caro --version
```

**Action Items**:
1. [ ] Create GitHub pre-release for v1.1.0-beta
2. [ ] Upload binaries to release
3. [ ] Write clear beta installation instructions
4. [ ] Test each method on clean system

**Output**: Beta testers can install successfully

---

### 1.4 Documentation Updates [HIGH PRIORITY]

**Objective**: All docs reflect beta status

**Files to Update/Verify**:
- [ ] README.md - Add beta notice at top
- [ ] INSTALLATION.md - Beta installation instructions
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md - Already done ✓
- [ ] GitHub release notes - Beta warnings

**Beta Notice Template**:
```markdown
⚠️ **BETA RELEASE** ⚠️

This is a beta release (v1.1.0-beta) intended for early testing.

- ✅ Safe for daily use by early adopters

## 🚫 What We're NOT Doing (Yet)

**These are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for current beta deployment**:

- ❌ General availability release
- ❌ crates.io publish (unless for beta testers who use cargo)
- ❌ Public announcement (no blog post, no social media)
- ❌ Major marketing push
- ❌ "Production ready" claims
- ❌ Homebrew formula
- ❌ Package manager distributions
- ❌ Recommendation for production use

**Why**: This is a beta release for controlled testing, not GA.

**When**: GA release ONLY when user explicitly requests it after successful beta.

---

## ✅ Pre-Flight Checklist Summary

Before deploying beta, verify:

- [ ] Version shows "1.1.0-beta" everywhere
- [ ] Binaries built and tested for target platforms
- [ ] All docs clearly mark as BETA
- [ ] GitHub pre-release ready
- [ ] Installation instructions written
- [ ] Beta tester recruitment materials ready
- [ ] Feedback collection system ready
- [ ] Monitoring plan in place
- [ ] Team aligned on beta scope (NOT GA)

---

## 📊 Success Criteria for Beta Phase

**After 5-day beta testing, we'll have**:
- 50+ command sessions from 3-5 testers
- Feedback surveys completed
- Bug reports triaged (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Privacy audit of beta telemetry
- Command success rate measured
- User satisfaction score collected

**Then we decide**: Fix bugs and prepare for GA (if requested)
