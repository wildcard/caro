Use Caro for real tasks today. No specific tests - just your actual workflow.

Remember to export telemetry tonight:
  caro telemetry export day2-export.json

Email the export to beta@caro.sh by 9 PM PT.
```

**Monitoring**:
- [ ] Check for P0 bug reports (immediate response)
- [ ] Monitor crates.io download count

---

#### January 15 (Day 3): Midpoint
**10:00 AM PT**: Send midpoint check-in
```
Subject: Day 3: Halfway there!

You're halfway through beta testing. Thank you!

Quick check-in:
- How's command generation quality? (subjective feel)
- Any bugs or issues?
- Performance acceptable?

Keep using Caro naturally. Export tonight:
  caro telemetry export day3-export.json
```

**Monitoring**:
- [ ] Check dropout risk (all testers responsive?)
- [ ] Aggregate success rates from telemetry
- [ ] Review GitHub issues for patterns

**Evening Analysis**:
```sql
-- Calculate success rate (interim)
SELECT
  backend_used,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN success = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(success) / COUNT(*), 1) as success_rate
FROM events
WHERE event_type = 'command_generation'
GROUP BY backend_used;
```

**Contingency**: If success rate <70%, document issues for emergency pattern expansion

---

#### January 16 (Day 4): Feedback Focus
**10:00 AM PT**: Send feedback reminder
```
Subject: Day 4: Feedback survey tomorrow

Tomorrow (Day 5) you'll receive the feedback survey. Start thinking about:

Keep using Caro today. Export tonight:
  caro telemetry export day4-export.json
```

**Monitoring**:
- [ ] Prepare feedback survey for deployment

```

---

### **Phase 3: Analysis (Jan 18-22)**

#### January 18-19: Data Analysis
**Use Analysis Template**: `.claude/releases/v1.1.0-beta-analysis-template.md`

**Day 1 (Jan 18): Quantitative Analysis**
```bash
# Aggregate all telemetry exports
cat day*.json > all-beta-telemetry.json

# Run queries from analysis template
jq '.events[] | select(.event_type == "command_generation")' all-beta-telemetry.json | \
  jq -s 'group_by(.backend_used) | map({backend: .[0].backend_used, count: length})'
```

**Metrics to Calculate**:
- Overall success rate (target: ≥80%)
- Backend usage distribution (static vs embedded)
- Platform distribution (macOS vs Linux)
- Performance (P50, P95 generation times)
- Safety blocks triggered (count, types)

**CRITICAL Privacy Audit**:
```bash
# Search for ANY PII patterns
jq '.events[] | select(.query != null or .command != null)' all-beta-telemetry.json

# Expected output: NOTHING (empty)
# Any output = PII FOUND = BLOCKS RELEASE
```

**Day 2 (Jan 19): Qualitative Analysis**
- Review all survey responses
- Calculate NPS score
- Identify themes (positive, negative, neutral)
- Categorize bug reports by severity
- Prioritize feature requests

**Deliverable**: Completed analysis document with go/no-go recommendation

---

#### January 20-22: Bug Fixes
**Priority**: Fix all P0 bugs (must be 0 to release)

**Process**:
1. Create issues for each bug
2. Prioritize by severity (P0 → P1 → P2)
3. Fix and test P0 bugs immediately
4. Defer P1/P2 to v1.1.1 if time-constrained

**Monitoring**: Track bug fix progress daily

---

#### January 23: Go/No-Go Decision
**Meeting Time**: 10:00 AM PT
**Duration**: 60 minutes
**Attendees**: Release Manager, Engineering Lead, Product Lead

**Use Go/No-Go Checklist**: `.claude/releases/v1.1.0-beta-go-nogo-checklist.md`

**Decision Options**:
1. **✅ GO**: All critical criteria met → proceed with Jan 24 release
2. **⚠️ CONDITIONAL GO**: Minor issues, release with known caveats
3. **❌ NO-GO**: Critical issues → delay release, fix, re-test

**Deliverables**:
- Signed go/no-go checklist
- Release decision email to team
- If GO: Schedule Jan 24 release communications

---

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### P0 Incident Response

**Definition**: Critical bug that affects core functionality, causes data loss, or violates privacy guarantees.

**Examples**:
- PII leaked in telemetry
- Crash on startup
- Command generation completely broken
- Security vulnerability

**Response** (from `.claude/releases/v1.1.0-beta-incident-response-plan.md`):

**Phase 1: Detection (0-15 min)**
```bash
# Create incident issue
gh issue create \
  --title "[P0] [Incident] Brief description" \
  --label "P0,incident" \
  --body "Impact: ...\nAffected users: ...\nSteps to reproduce: ..."
```

**Phase 2: Immediate Mitigation (15-60 min)**
- **Option A**: Rollback (if breaking)
  ```bash
  # Emergency yank from crates.io
  cargo yank --vers 1.1.0-beta

  # Hide GitHub release
  gh release delete v1.1.0-beta
  ```
- **Option B**: Hot-fix (if fixable quickly)
- **Option C**: Workaround (document mitigation)

**Phase 3: Communication (within 2 hours)**
```markdown
**Incident Notice** (GitHub Discussions + Twitter)

We've identified a critical issue in v1.1.0-beta:
[Brief description]

Status: [Investigating / Mitigated / Fixed]
Impact: [Who is affected]
Action required: [What users should do]
ETA for fix: [Timeframe]

Updates: [Link to tracking issue]
```

**Phase 4: Investigation (parallel with mitigation)**
- Root cause analysis
- Reproduce in controlled environment
- Identify scope of impact

**Phase 5: Resolution (hours to days)**
- Develop fix
- Test thoroughly
- Deploy hot-fix
- Verify resolution

**Phase 6: Post-Incident (within 24 hours of resolution)**
- Post-mortem meeting
- Document lessons learned
- Update incident response plan
- Communicate resolution to community

---

### Privacy Incident (PII Leaked)

**This is the HIGHEST PRIORITY incident type.**

**Immediate Actions** (within 15 minutes):
```bash
# STOP all telemetry collection immediately
# If backend deployed, disable endpoint
# Send emergency email to all users

# Template:
Subject: URGENT: Telemetry disabled due to privacy incident

We've discovered that telemetry may have collected personal data
contrary to our privacy policy. We have:

1. Disabled all telemetry collection immediately
2. Are investigating the scope of the issue
3. Will delete affected data once identified
4. Will notify affected users directly

Action required:
- Update to emergency patch [version] immediately
- Or disable telemetry: caro config set telemetry.enabled false

We take privacy extremely seriously and apologize for this incident.

Full details: [GitHub issue]
```

**Investigation**:
- Identify what PII was collected
- Determine how many users affected
- Review validation layer failure
- Fix validation code
- Re-test with aggressive PII testing

**Resolution**:
- Delete ALL affected telemetry data
- Notify affected users individually
- Public incident report with full transparency
- Consider switching to opt-in telemetry
- May delay GA release until verified safe

## 🎓 Lessons from Planning

### What Worked Well in Planning
1. **Comprehensive upfront documentation**: Having all scenarios documented prevents scrambling during high-pressure moments
2. **Multi-phase approach**: Breaking into Pre-Beta → Beta → Analysis → Release → Post-Release creates clear mental models
3. **Risk-based thinking**: Risk register identifies issues before they occur
4. **Data-driven decisions**: Go/no-go checklist removes emotion from release decisions
5. **Privacy-first design**: Multi-layer validation + manual inspection + transparent policies builds trust

### Key Principles Applied
1. **User trust is everything**: Privacy incidents are release-blocking
2. **Small, focused beta**: 3-5 quality testers > 10-20 variable-quality testers
3. **Fast iteration**: 5-day beta allows quick feedback loop
4. **Proactive communication**: Daily reminders and check-ins prevent dropout
5. **Emergency preparedness**: Incident response plan enables fast reaction
6. **Transparency**: Public roadmap, open issues, clear decision-making builds community trust

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. ❌ **Skipping preflight checklist**: Saves 2 hours, costs 2 days in bug fixes
2. ❌ **Unclear success criteria**: Leads to subjective, emotional release decisions
3. ❌ **Poor communication cadence**: Testers disengage, dropout increases
4. ❌ **Ignoring edge cases**: "It probably won't happen" → it will happen
5. ❌ **Over-promising in announcements**: Under-promise, over-deliver
6. ❌ **Rushing the go/no-go decision**: Take time, review data thoroughly
7. ❌ **Neglecting post-release monitoring**: Issues compound if not caught early
