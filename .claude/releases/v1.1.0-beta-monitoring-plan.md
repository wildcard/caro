# v1.1.0-beta Post-Release Monitoring Plan

**Purpose**: Track key metrics and health indicators after v1.1.0-beta release
**Timeline**: January 24 - February 15, 2026 (3 weeks)
**Owner**: Release Manager + Engineering Team

---

## Monitoring Philosophy

1. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Let metrics guide v1.1.1 priorities
2. **Early Detection**: Catch issues before they become critical
3. **User-Centric**: Focus on user experience, not vanity metrics
4. **Privacy-Respecting**: Only collect what's necessary, respect opt-outs

---

## Critical Metrics (P0 - Monitor Daily)

### 1. System Health

| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold | Check Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Crash rate | <0.1% | >0.5% | Real-time |
| P0 bug reports | 0 | ≥1 | Real-time |
| Privacy leak reports | 0 | ≥1 | Real-time |
| crates.io yank status | Not yanked | Yanked | Real-time |

**Data Sources**:
- GitHub issues (monitor `P0`, `critical`, `security` labels)
- Email (beta@caro.sh)
- Social media mentions (search for "caro crash", "caro bug")
- crates.io API (yank status)

**Alerting**:
- P0 bug: Immediate Slack/email to team
- Privacy leak: Emergency incident response (use `v1.1.0-beta-incident-response-plan.md`)
- Crash spike: Investigate within 4 hours

---

### 2. Privacy & Security

| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold | Check Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| PII in telemetry | 0 reports | ≥1 report | Real-time |
| Security vulnerabilities | 0 disclosed | ≥1 disclosed | Daily (Dependabot) |
| Telemetry opt-out rate | <30% | >50% | Weekly |
| Privacy concern rate | <10% users | >20% users | Weekly (from feedback) |

**Data Sources**:
- User reports (email, issues, social)
- Telemetry backend (opt-out events)
- GitHub Dependabot alerts
- Community feedback (surveys, discussions)

**Alerting**:
- Any PII report: STOP telemetry backend immediately, investigate
- Security vulnerability: Assess severity, patch within 48 hours
- High opt-out rate: Review privacy messaging, identify concerns

---

### 3. Installation Success

| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold | Check Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Installation failure rate | <5% | >15% | Daily |
| Install script errors | <2% | >10% | Daily |
| Platform-specific failures | <5% per platform | >20% any platform | Daily |

**Data Sources**:
- GitHub issues (label: `installation`)
- crates.io download stats (proxy for attempts)
- User reports (email, discussions)
- Telemetry: SessionStart events (successful installs)

**Alerting**:
- Spike in installation issues: Investigate within 24 hours
- Platform-specific spike: Check binary builds, platform compatibility

---

## High-Priority Metrics (P1 - Monitor Every 2-3 Days)

### 4. Command Generation Quality

| Metric | Target | Baseline | Check Frequency |
|--------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| Command success rate | ≥80% | 94.8% (test suite) | Every 3 days |
| Static matcher hit rate | ≥60% | TBD from beta | Every 3 days |
| Average generation time (P50) | <100ms | TBD from beta | Every 3 days |
| Average generation time (P95) | <2000ms | TBD from beta | Every 3 days |
| Safety block rate | <5% | TBD from beta | Every 3 days |

**Data Sources**:
- Telemetry backend (CommandGeneration events)
- Aggregated reports (exported by users in air-gapped mode)
- User feedback (surveys, issues)

**Analysis**:
```sql
-- Example queries for telemetry backend
SELECT
  AVG(CASE WHEN success = true THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) as success_rate,
  AVG(generation_time_ms) as avg_time_ms,
  AVG(CASE WHEN backend_used = 'static' THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) as static_hit_rate
FROM command_generation_events
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '3 days'
```

**Alerting**:
- Success rate <75%: Review failure patterns, prioritize fixes
- Generation time P95 >5s: Performance investigation
- Static hit rate <50%: Pattern expansion needed

---

### 5. User Engagement

| Metric | Target | Check Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Daily active users (DAU) | Growing | Every 3 days |
| Sessions per user | ≥5/week | Every 3 days |

**Data Sources**:
- Telemetry backend (SessionStart events, user_session_id)
- crates.io download trends
- GitHub repo activity (stars, watches, forks)

**Analysis**:
- Are users returning after Day 1?
- What's the typical usage pattern? (daily vs weekly)
- Are power users emerging? (>20 commands/week)

---

### 6. Community Sentiment

| Metric | Target | Check Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| GitHub issues (bugs vs features) | <10 bugs/week | Every 2 days |
| Positive vs negative social mentions | >70% positive | Every 3 days |
| GitHub Discussions engagement | Growing | Weekly |
| NPS score (from feedback) | ≥40 | Weekly (aggregated) |

**Data Sources**:
- GitHub issues (categorize by type)

- User surveys (NPS question)

**Analysis**:
- What are common complaints? (prioritize for v1.1.1)

| macOS vs Linux usage | 60/40 split (guess) | Weekly |
| Apple Silicon vs Intel | 70/30 (guess) | Weekly |
| Top 5 shell types | bash, zsh, fish, ... | Weekly |

**Data Sources**:

## Metric Interpretation Guide

### Command Success Rate

**Target**: ≥80%

**Interpretation**:
- **>90%**: Excellent, exceeding expectations
- **80-90%**: Good, meeting targets
- **70-80%**: Acceptable, but investigate top failures
- **<70%**: Concerning, prioritize quality improvements

**False Positives**:
- Safety blocks counted as failures (adjust: count as success)
- User typos in natural language input (unavoidable)

---

### Telemetry Opt-Out Rate

**Target**: <30%

**Interpretation**:
- **<20%**: Excellent, users trust the system
- **20-30%**: Good, within expectations
- **30-50%**: Concerning, review privacy messaging
- **>50%**: Critical, privacy concerns widespread

**Context Matters**:
- Security engineers expected to opt out (natural)
- Opt-out immediately after install: messaging issue
- Opt-out after using: feature worked, user satisfied, values privacy

---

### Installation Failure Rate

**Target**: <5%

**Interpretation**:
- **<5%**: Excellent, smooth install experience
- **5-10%**: Acceptable, but investigate common issues
- **10-20%**: Concerning, installation barriers
- **>20%**: Critical, blocking adoption

**Common Causes**:
- Missing dependencies (system libraries)
- Platform-specific binary issues
- Documentation unclear

---

## Monitoring Retrospective Questions

After 3 weeks, review:

1. **Were the right metrics tracked?**
   - What metrics were most valuable for decisions?
   - What metrics were noise?
   - What should be added for v1.1.1?

2. **Were alert thresholds correct?**
   - Too many false alarms?
   - Missed any critical issues?
   - Adjust thresholds for next release?

3. **Was monitoring sustainable?**
   - Did it fit within time budget (2-3 hours/week)?
   - Was the team burned out by alerts?
   - Can we automate more?

4. **Did it drive better decisions?**
   - Did metrics inform v1.1.1 priorities?
   - Did we catch issues before they became critical?
   - Would we do this again?

---

## Appendix: Query Examples

### Telemetry Backend Queries

**Command success rate by category**:
```sql
SELECT
  metadata->>'category' as category,
  AVG(CASE WHEN success = true THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) * 100 as success_pct,
  COUNT(*) as total_commands
FROM command_generation_events
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_commands DESC;
```

**Static matcher hit rate**:
```sql
SELECT
  AVG(CASE WHEN backend_used = 'static' THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) * 100 as static_hit_pct,
  COUNT(*) as total_commands
FROM command_generation_events
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

**Platform distribution**:
```sql
SELECT
  metadata->>'os_name' as platform,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_session_id) as unique_users
FROM session_start_events
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY platform;
```
