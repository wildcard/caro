## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1 Command Generation [BLOCKING]

**Static Matcher**:
```bash
# Test website claim examples
caro "files modified in the last week"
caro "files larger than 10MB"
caro "processes using the most memory"
caro "my IP address"
```
- [ ] All 4 website examples work (100% pass rate)
- [ ] Commands are correct for platform (macOS vs Linux)
- [ ] Generation is fast (<100ms for static)
- [ ] No crashes or errors

**LLM Fallback (Embedded)**:
```bash
# Test complex query (should use embedded backend)
caro "find log files modified yesterday that contain errors"
```
- [ ] Command generated (even if not perfect)
- [ ] No crashes or hangs
- [ ] Reasonable generation time (<5s)
- [ ] Backend selection logged correctly

---

### 2.2 Telemetry System [BLOCKING]

**First-Run Consent**:
```bash
# Test on fresh install (delete database first)
rm -f ~/.local/share/caro/telemetry.db
caro "list files"
```
- [ ] Consent prompt appears on first use
- [ ] Prompt is clear and understandable
- [ ] User can accept or decline
- [ ] Choice is persisted (no re-prompt on second command)

**Data Collection**:
```bash
# Generate a few commands
caro "list files"
caro "processes"
caro "disk usage"

# Check collected data
caro telemetry show
```
- [ ] Events are recorded
- [ ] Timestamps are correct
- [ ] Platform info is accurate
- [ ] No PII visible in output (manually inspect)

**Export Function**:
```bash
caro telemetry export test-export.json

# Inspect the export
cat test-export.json | jq '.'
```
- [ ] Export creates valid JSON file
- [ ] File contains expected event types
- [ ] No PII in exported data (manually inspect every field)
- [ ] File is readable and well-formatted

**Show Function**:
```bash
caro telemetry show
```
- [ ] Displays events in readable format
- [ ] Shows recent events first
- [ ] Formatting is clear
- [ ] No errors or crashes

**Clear Function**:
```bash
caro telemetry clear
caro telemetry show
```
- [ ] Clears all events
- [ ] Show returns empty or "no events"
- [ ] No errors

**Disable Function**:
```bash
caro config set telemetry.enabled false
caro "list files"
caro telemetry show
```
- [ ] Telemetry respects disabled config
- [ ] No new events collected after disabling
- [ ] Commands still work with telemetry off

---

### 2.3 Safety Validation [HIGH PRIORITY]

**Test Dangerous Commands** (should block or warn):
```bash
caro "delete all files in root"
caro "remove everything recursively"
caro "format my hard drive"
```
- [ ] Safety validation triggers
- [ ] User sees clear warning
- [ ] Commands are not executed automatically
- [ ] User must explicitly confirm (if supported)

**Test Safe Commands** (should NOT block):
```bash
caro "list files in home directory"
caro "show running processes"
caro "check disk usage"
```
- [ ] No false positive warnings
- [ ] Commands execute normally
- [ ] No unnecessary friction

## 8. Final Smoke Tests

### 8.1 End-to-End User Flow [BLOCKING]

**Complete New User Experience**:
```bash
# 1. Fresh install
curl -fsSL https://caro.sh/install.sh | sh

# 2. First command (see consent)
caro "list files"
# → Should see consent prompt
# → Accept consent
# → Get command

# 3. A few more commands
caro "processes using memory"
caro "disk usage"

# 4. View telemetry
caro telemetry show
# → Should see 3 events

# 5. Export telemetry
caro telemetry export test.json
# → Should create JSON file

# 6. Inspect export (MANUALLY CHECK FOR PII)
cat test.json | jq '.'
# → Verify NO personal information

# 7. Disable telemetry
caro config set telemetry.enabled false

# 8. Verify disabled
caro "check this works"
caro telemetry show
# → Should show no new events

# 9. Cleanup
rm test.json
```

**Result**:
- [ ] ✅ All steps worked perfectly
- [ ] ⚠️ Minor issues (document):
- [ ] ❌ Failed (BLOCKING - fix before beta)

---

caro "list processes by myusername"
caro "check email logs"

# Export
caro telemetry export privacy-audit.json

# Inspect EVERY field manually

## Appendix: Quick Command Reference

### Useful Commands During Pre-Flight

**Check binary platforms**:
```bash
file caro-macos-aarch64    # Should show: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
file caro-linux-x86_64     # Should show: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64
```

**Verify version**:
```bash
./caro --version | grep "1.1.0-beta"
```

**Check crates.io**:
```bash
cargo search caro | grep "1.1.0-beta"
```

**Test telemetry database**:
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.local/share/caro/telemetry.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events;"
```

**Privacy inspection with jq**:
```bash
# Check for common PII patterns
cat export.json | jq -r '.. | strings' | grep -E "@|\.com|/Users/|/home/"
```

---

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Created**: January 8, 2026
**Use Date**: January 12, 2026 (evening)
**Owner**: Release Manager
**Duration**: ~2 hours to complete thoroughly

**Remember**: This checklist is designed to catch issues BEFORE beta testers encounter them. Take your time, verify thoroughly, and don't skip blocking items. Better to delay one day than to have a broken beta experience.
