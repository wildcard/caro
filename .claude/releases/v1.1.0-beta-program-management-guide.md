## Overview

### What is This Guide?

This is the operational manual for managing the entire Caro v1.1.0 beta program from recruitment through wrap-up. It consolidates all processes, templates, and best practices needed to execute a successful beta test.

### Who Should Use This?

- **Primary**: Release Manager (overall program coordination)
- **Secondary**: Lead Developer (technical support), Support Engineer (tester assistance)

### Scope

- **In Scope**: Recruitment, selection, onboarding, daily operations, issue management, data analysis, wrap-up
- **Out of Scope**: Product development, marketing strategy, post-release support (see Post-Release Support Plan)

---

## Beta Program Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Validate Command Accuracy**: Achieve ≥85% success rate across diverse real-world usage
2. **Identify Critical Issues**: Find and document all P0/P1 bugs before public release
3. **Test Platform Compatibility**: Validate macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon) and Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora)
4. **Validate Privacy Claims**: Confirm ZERO PII in telemetry with real user data
5. **Assess User Experience**: Measure satisfaction (target: ≥4.0/5.0) and gather qualitative feedback

### Secondary Goals

1. **Build Early Adopter Community**: Cultivate advocates who will help others post-release
2. **Refine Documentation**: Identify gaps in README, installation, and usage docs
3. **Validate Safety Patterns**: Confirm dangerous command blocking works as claimed
4. **Stress Test Telemetry**: Ensure privacy-preserving analytics work at scale

**When**: Every new GitHub issue, 3x per day (morning, afternoon, evening)

**Process**:

1. **Read the issue**: Understand the problem
2. **Reproduce** (if possible): Can you recreate it?
3. **Assign Priority**:
   - **P0 (Critical)**: Complete failure, data loss, security issue
   - **P1 (High)**: Major functionality broken, affects core use cases
   - **P2 (Medium)**: Minor functionality issue, workaround exists
   - **P3 (Low)**: Cosmetic, minor inconvenience, documentation gap

4. **Label the issue**:
   - Priority: `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3`
   - Type: `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`, `documentation`
   - Platform: `macOS`, `Linux`, `platform-agnostic`
   - Status: `investigating`, `fixing`, `waiting-for-info`

5. **Assign owner**:
   - P0/P1: Lead Developer (immediately)

## Data Collection & Analysis

### Data Sources

1. **Daily Check-Ins** (Discord)
2. **Final Survey** (Google Forms)
3. **GitHub Issues** (Bug reports, feature requests)
4. **Telemetry Exports** (JSON files from testers)
5. **Discord Conversations** (Qualitative feedback)
6. **Optional Interviews** (Deep-dive insights)

### Daily Check-In Data

**Collected Daily**:
- Participation: Did you use Caro today? (Yes/No)
- Rating: Experience rating (1-5)
- Frequency: How many commands? (Estimate)
- Qualitative: Highlights, frustrations, observations

**Analysis** (End of each day):
1. Calculate participation rate: X/Y testers
2. Calculate average rating: Mean of all ratings
3. Identify themes: What's working? What's not?
4. Flag urgent issues: Any P0/P1 mentioned?

**Dashboard** (Update daily):

```markdown
## Beta Testing Dashboard - Day X

**Participation**: X/Y testers (Z%)
**Average Rating**: X.X/5.0

### Ratings Trend
Day 1: 4.2/5.0
Day 2: 4.5/5.0
Day 3: 4.1/5.0
...

### Top Themes (Positive)
1. [Theme]: Mentioned by X testers
2. [Theme]: Mentioned by X testers

### Top Themes (Negative)
1. [Theme]: Mentioned by X testers
2. [Theme]: Mentioned by X testers

### Issues Opened
- P0: X issues
- P1: X issues
- P2: X issues
- P3: X issues
```

### Final Survey Data

**Survey Questions** (See Beta Tester Handbook for full survey):

**Section 1: Overall Experience**
1. Overall satisfaction (1-5)
2. Likelihood to recommend (1-10, NPS)
3. Compared to current workflow (Much better / Better / Same / Worse / Much worse)

**Section 2: Features**
4. Command accuracy (1-5)
5. Safety warnings (1-5)
6. Error messages (1-5)
7. Performance (1-5)

**Section 3: Qualitative**
8. Best feature (Open text)
9. Most frustrating (Open text)
10. Missing features (Open text)

**Analysis** (January 18, post-beta):

1. **Quantitative Analysis**:
   - Calculate mean and median for all ratings
   - Calculate NPS score: % Promoters (9-10) - % Detractors (0-6)
   - Identify low-scoring areas (< 4.0 = needs attention)

2. **Qualitative Analysis**:
   - Thematic coding of open-text responses
   - Identify recurring themes (mentioned by 2+ testers)
   - Prioritize by frequency × impact

3. **Comparison**:
   - Survey results vs daily check-ins (consistency?)
   - Survey results vs telemetry (stated vs actual behavior?)

### Telemetry Export Analysis

**Data Collected** (from `caro telemetry export beta-test.json`):
- Total commands run
- Success rate (successful / total)
- Command categories used (file_management, system_monitoring, etc.)
- Platform details (OS, version)
- Performance metrics (avg response time)

**Privacy Validation** (CRITICAL):

1. **Manual Audit** (Lead Developer):
```bash
# Tester exports their data
caro telemetry export tester-[name]-beta.json

# Developer inspects for PII
cat tester-[name]-beta.json | jq .
```

**Check for**:
- Email addresses
- File paths with usernames
- IP addresses
- Environment variables
- API keys or tokens
- Any personally identifiable information

**Result**: MUST be ZERO PII. Any PII = RELEASE BLOCKER.

2. **Automated Privacy Audit**:
```bash
# Run privacy audit script on all tester exports
scripts/privacy_audit.sh tester-*.json
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ ZERO PII VIOLATIONS

Files checked: 5
Total events: 1,247
PII patterns checked: 23
Violations found: 0

PRIVACY VALIDATION: PASSED
```

**If PII Found**: STOP RELEASE. Investigate, fix, re-validate.

3. **Aggregate Analysis**:

Combine all tester telemetry into aggregate metrics:

```bash
# Aggregate telemetry from all testers
scripts/aggregate_telemetry.sh tester-*.json > beta-aggregate.json
```

**Metrics to Extract**:
- **Overall Success Rate**: X% (target: ≥85%)
- **Commands by Category**:
  - file_management: X commands, Y% success
  - system_monitoring: X commands, Y% success
  - ...
- **Platform Breakdown**:
  - macOS: X commands, Y% success
  - Linux: X commands, Y% success
- **Performance**:
  - Avg response time: X ms
  - P95 response time: X ms

### Data Synthesis

**Goal**: Combine all data sources into comprehensive insights
