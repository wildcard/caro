- Ask for generation time estimate
- Check platform resources
- May be expected for complex queries

## 💡 Pro Tips

2. **Respond fast**: <2hr during beta builds trust
3. **Thank often**: Gratitude keeps testers engaged
4. **Document issues**: Don't rely on memory
5. **Stay calm**: Issues are normal, not failures
6. **Use templates**: Save time, stay consistent
7. **Ask for help**: Don't solo debug at 2 AM
8. **Trust the process**: We planned thoroughly

## 🔄 If Things Go Wrong

### Scenario: Critical Bug on Jan 15
1. Ask tester to stop testing
2. Assess severity (P0 vs P1)
3. Hot fix within 4 hours if P0
4. Extend beta by 1 day if needed
5. Re-test with same tester
6. Document in incident log

### Scenario: Low Survey Response on Jan 17
1. Personal follow-up emails
2. Offer call/chat instead of survey
3. Accept partial responses
4. Don't delay go/no-go unnecessarily

### Scenario: Privacy Leak Found
1. **STOP EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY**
2. Use incident response plan (P0)
3. Notify all testers within 1 hour
4. Fix validation layer (emergency)
5. Re-test all exports manually
6. No release until verified safe
