## FAQ for Recruiters (Internal)

### Q: How many testers should we recruit?
**A**: 3-5 is ideal. More than 5 becomes hard to manage. Fewer than 3 risks insufficient data.

### Q: What if we get too many applicants?
**A**: Good problem! Prioritize diversity (experience levels, platforms, use cases). Put others on waitlist for v1.1.1 or v1.2.0.

### Q: What if we don't get enough applicants by Jan 12?
**A**: Extend deadline by 1 day (Jan 13 morning). Reach out directly to engaged community members. Consider offering incentives (swag, credit, etc.).

### Q: Should we offer compensation?
**A**: Not required for 5-day beta with <1 hour commitment. Credit in release notes + early access is usually sufficient. If needed, consider swag (stickers, t-shirt).

### Q: Can beta testers be anonymous?
**A**: Yes, but we need some way to communicate (email). They can opt out of credit in release notes.

### Q: What if a selected tester drops out?
**A**: Contact waitlist backup immediately. If early (before Jan 14), they can still participate. If late (Jan 15+), may not have enough time.
