## Welcome, Beta Tester! 🎉

Thank you for helping us improve Caro! As a beta tester, you're getting early access to v1.1.0-beta in exchange for valuable feedback that will shape the future of the product.

This guide explains what we're testing, how to participate, and what to expect.

---

## What You're Testing

### Primary Focus: Privacy-First Telemetry

v1.1.0-beta introduces an **optional telemetry system** to help us improve Caro. Your primary role is to:

1. **Use Caro naturally** for your daily shell tasks
2. **Verify zero PII** in collected telemetry data
3. **Provide feedback** on the beta experience

### What We're Measuring

**Quantitative** (from telemetry):
- Command success rate (target: ≥80%)
- Static matcher performance
- Generation time and latency
- Error patterns and safety blocks

**Qualitative** (from your feedback):
- User satisfaction (target: ≥4.0/5.0)
- Privacy comfort level
- Performance acceptability
- Installation experience
- Documentation clarity

## Beta Testing Timeline

### Day 1: Setup (Monday, Jan 13)

**Time Required**: 15-20 minutes

**Tasks**:
1. **Install Caro v1.1.0-beta**
   ```bash
   # Via install script (recommended)
   curl -fsSL https://caro.sh/install-beta.sh | sh

   # OR via cargo
   cargo install caro --version 1.1.0-beta
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   caro --version
   # Should show: caro 1.1.0-beta (...)
   ```

3. **Complete First-Run Setup**
   - Answer telemetry consent prompt
   - For beta testing, **please opt-in** (telemetry ON)
   - You can always disable it later: `caro telemetry disable`

4. **Verify Telemetry is Working**
   ```bash
   caro telemetry status
   # Should show: Status: Enabled

   caro telemetry show
   # Should show: (probably empty at this point)
   ```

5. **Report Installation Issues** (if any)
   - Platform: [macOS/Linux]
   - Architecture: [Apple Silicon/Intel/x86_64/ARM64]
   - Error message: [paste here]
   - Installation method: [script/cargo/source]

### Days 2-4: Natural Usage (Tuesday-Thursday, Jan 14-16)

**Time Required**: 10-15 minutes per day

**Tasks**:
1. **Use Caro for Real Tasks**
   - Don't try to "test" it artificially
   - Use it for your actual shell command needs
   - Try different types of queries:
     - File operations: "find large files", "list files modified today"
     - System monitoring: "show top memory processes"
     - Text processing: "search for pattern in logs"
     - Whatever you'd naturally use the shell for!

2. **Note Your Experience** (informal, mental notes)
   - What worked well?
   - What didn't work?
   - Were generated commands correct?
   - Were error messages helpful?
   - Did it feel fast/slow?

3. **Daily Export** (end of each day)
   ```bash
   # Export telemetry for privacy inspection
   caro telemetry export telemetry-day2.json
   caro telemetry export telemetry-day3.json
   caro telemetry export telemetry-day4.json
   ```

4. **Quick Privacy Check** (optional, but encouraged)
   ```bash
   # Look at the JSON to ensure it's not collecting your commands
   cat telemetry-day2.json | jq
   ```

   **What you should see**: Platform info, timing data, success/failure counts
   **What you should NOT see**: Your actual commands, file paths, environment variables

### Day 5: Feedback (Friday, Jan 17)

**Time Required**: 15-20 minutes

**Tasks**:
1. **Final Export**
   ```bash
   caro telemetry export telemetry-final.json
   ```

2. **Privacy Inspection** (IMPORTANT!)
   - Review all your telemetry exports
   - Check for any personal information:
     - ❌ Commands or input text?
     - ❌ File paths or directory names?
     - ❌ Email addresses or usernames?
     - ❌ API keys or passwords?
     - ❌ Environment variables?
   - If you find ANY personal info, **report immediately**!

3. **Complete Feedback Survey**
   - Link: [https://forms.gle/...] (will be provided)
   - Takes ~10 minutes
   - All questions optional, but more detail helps!

4. **Send Telemetry Exports** (optional, but very helpful)
   - Email to: beta@caro.sh
   - Subject: "Beta Telemetry - [YourGitHubUsername]"
   - Attach: All telemetry-*.json files
   - Note: Only send if you're comfortable after reviewing!
