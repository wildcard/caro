## What is Caro?

**Caro** is a command-line tool that translates natural language into shell commands. Instead of memorizing complex command syntax, you simply describe what you want to do, and Caro generates the appropriate command for you.

### Example Use Cases

**File Management**:
```bash
$ caro "list files modified today"
# Generates: find . -type f -mtime 0

$ caro "find files larger than 10MB"
# Generates: find . -type f -size +10M
```

**System Monitoring**:
```bash
$ caro "show top 5 memory-consuming processes"
# Generates: ps aux | sort -k4 -rn | head -5

$ caro "check which process is using port 8080"
# Generates: lsof -i :8080
```

**Text Processing**:
```bash
$ caro "count lines in all Python files"
# Generates: find . -name "*.py" -exec wc -l {} + | tail -1

$ caro "search for TODO in JavaScript files"
# Generates: grep -rn "TODO" --include="*.js" .
```

### How It Works

Caro uses two approaches to generate commands:

1. **Static Matcher**: Fast pattern matching for common commands (86.2% success rate)
2. **LLM Backend**: AI-powered generation for complex or uncommon queries

The system automatically chooses the best approach for your query, prioritizing speed and accuracy.

---

## Beta Testing Goals

### What We're Testing

**Primary Focus Areas**:

1. **Command Generation Accuracy** (Most Important)
   - Does Caro generate the correct command for your query?
   - Are generated commands safe to execute?
   - Do commands work on your specific platform (macOS/Linux)?

2. **User Experience**
   - Is the interface intuitive?
   - Are error messages helpful?
   - Is the tool fast enough?
   - Does it integrate well into your workflow?

3. **Platform Compatibility**
   - Does Caro work correctly on your OS?
   - Are platform-specific commands (BSD vs GNU) handled properly?
   - Any installation issues?

4. **Telemetry & Privacy**
   - Is the opt-in/opt-out process clear?
   - Do you feel your privacy is respected?
   - Is telemetry data truly anonymous?

5. **Safety Validation**
   - Does Caro warn about dangerous commands?
   - Are destructive operations properly flagged?
   - Do you feel confident using generated commands?

### Success Criteria

We consider beta testing successful if:
- **Command success rate ≥85%**: Most queries produce correct, safe commands
- **User satisfaction ≥4.0/5.0**: You're happy with the overall experience
- **Zero privacy violations**: No personal data in telemetry
- **Platform compatibility**: Works well on both macOS and Linux

- ✅ Does it gracefully fail for impossible requests?

---

### Testing Best Practices

**Mix Simple and Complex**:
- Start with simple queries to build confidence
- Gradually try more complex multi-step tasks
- Don't just test "happy path"—try edge cases

**Test Your Actual Workflow**:
- Use Caro for real tasks you need to do
- Authentic usage reveals the most valuable insights
- Don't just test for the sake of testing

**Note Platform Differences**:
- If you're on macOS, note if commands seem Linux-specific
- If you're on Linux, note if commands seem macOS-specific
- Platform mismatches are important to report!

**Try to Break It**:
- Intentionally vague queries
- Impossible requests
- Queries with typos
- Commands that might be dangerous

**Use Caro Alongside Regular Commands**:
- Compare Caro's output to what you'd normally type
- Is Caro's version better, worse, or equivalent?
- Would you use Caro's command in real work?

---

## How to Report Issues

### When to Report

**Always Report**:
- ❌ Caro generates an incorrect command
- ❌ Command is unsafe or destructive without warning
- ❌ Platform mismatch (Linux command on macOS, or vice versa)
- ❌ Caro crashes or hangs
- ❌ Error messages are confusing or unhelpful
- ❌ Installation or setup problems
- ❌ Privacy concerns (suspicious telemetry data)

**Consider Reporting**:
- 🤔 Feature works but could be better
- 🤔 Unclear documentation
- 🤔 Slow performance (>2 seconds for simple query)
- 🤔 Unexpected behavior (even if not technically broken)

**Don't Need to Report**:
- ✅ Caro works as expected
- ✅ Feature requests (save for final survey)
- ✅ General questions (ask in Discord instead)

---

### How to Report (GitHub Issues)

**Step 1: Check Existing Issues**
- Search: https://github.com/your-org/caro/issues

## Telemetry & Privacy

### What is Telemetry?

Telemetry is **anonymous usage data** that helps us understand how Caro is being used and where it needs improvement.

**What We Collect** (if you opt in):
- ✅ Commands generated (anonymized, no personal data)
- ✅ Success/failure status
- ✅ Performance metrics (response time)
- ✅ Platform information (OS, shell type)
- ✅ Error types (for debugging)

**What We NEVER Collect**:
- ❌ Personal information (name, email, etc.)
- ❌ File paths or directory names
- ❌ IP addresses
- ❌ Environment variables
- ❌ Your actual data or files

### Privacy Guarantee

**ZERO PII**: We have automated tests (220+) and manual audits to ensure **zero personally identifiable information** ever enters telemetry. This is a **blocking requirement** for release.

**You Control It**: Telemetry is **opt-in** and you can disable it anytime:
```bash
# Disable telemetry
caro telemetry disable

# Check status
caro telemetry status

# Re-enable later
caro telemetry enable
```

### Viewing Your Telemetry

**You can see exactly what we collect**:
```bash
# Export your telemetry data
caro telemetry export my-data.json

# Open and inspect
cat my-data.json | jq
```

**Example telemetry event** (fully anonymous):
```json
{
  "event_type": "command_generated",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-13T10:30:00Z",
  "platform": "macos",
  "shell": "zsh",
  "query_length": 25,
  "command_length": 42,
  "backend": "static",
  "success": true,
  "response_time_ms": 15
}
```

**Notice**: No personal data, no file paths, no identifiable information.

### Why Telemetry Matters for Beta

Telemetry helps us answer critical questions:
- Which command categories are most used?
- Where is Caro failing?
- Which platforms have issues?
- Is performance acceptable?

**Without telemetry**, we rely solely on manual reports, which might miss systemic issues affecting many users silently.

**Your choice**: Opt-in to help us improve Caro, or opt-out for complete privacy. Both are respected!

## Tips for Effective Testing

### 1. Start Simple, Go Complex

**Day 1-2**: Stick to basic commands
- Get comfortable with the interface
- Build confidence that it works
- Learn the common patterns

**Day 3-5**: Push boundaries
- Try complex queries
- Test edge cases
- Explore unusual scenarios

---

### 2. Use Caro for Real Work

**Most Valuable Feedback** comes from authentic usage:
- Integrate Caro into your actual daily tasks
- Try to solve real problems
- Use it alongside your normal workflow

**Less Valuable**: Artificial testing scenarios
- Testing just to test
- Queries you'd never actually use
- Contrived edge cases (though some edge case testing is useful!)

---

### 3. Compare to Your Normal Workflow

**Ask Yourself**:
- Would I use Caro's command over what I normally type?
- Is Caro's version better, worse, or equivalent?
- Does Caro save me time, or add friction?
- Would I recommend Caro to a colleague?

---

### 4. Document the Journey

**Jot Down Quick Notes** as you test:
- What worked surprisingly well?
- What was confusing or frustrating?
- What did you expect that didn't happen?
- What unexpected behavior did you notice?

**Don't Wait Until the End**: Fresh observations are most valuable!

---

### 5. Think About Diverse Scenarios

**Test Different**:
- **Platforms**: If you have access to both macOS and Linux, test both!
- **Command Types**: Don't just test one category
- **Complexity Levels**: Simple, medium, complex queries
- **Ambiguity**: Clear queries vs. vague queries
- **Error Cases**: Invalid queries, impossible requests

---

### 6. Don't Be Afraid to Break Things

**We WANT You To**:
- Try dangerous-sounding queries (Caro should warn you!)
- Test with typos and ambiguous language
- Push Caro to its limits
- Find edge cases we didn't consider

**Safety Net**: Caro has validation layers to prevent truly dangerous commands. If something slips through, **report it immediately** (P1 bug).

---

### 7. Engage with the Community

**Other Beta Testers Are Valuable**:
- Share experiences in Discord
- Learn from others' discoveries
- Collaborate on edge case testing
- Build a supportive testing community

---

### 8. Be Honest

**We Value Honesty Over Politeness**:
- If Caro frustrates you, tell us!
- If a feature is confusing, say so!
- If you wouldn't use Caro, explain why!
- If something is broken, don't sugarcoat it!

**Constructive criticism** helps us improve far more than generic praise.
