## Section 4: Risk Management & Contingency

### Capacity Risks

**Risk 1: Team Member Unavailable**
- **Probability**: Medium (illness, emergency)
- **Impact**: High if critical path owner
- **Mitigation**:
  - Cross-train team members
  - Document runbooks
  - Identify backup owners
  - Keep buffer capacity (30%)

**Risk 2: Tasks Take Longer Than Estimated**
- **Probability**: High (planning is hard)
- **Impact**: Medium (schedule slip)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Conservative estimates (multiply by 1.5x)
  - Buffer capacity (30%)
  - Descope P2/P3 tasks if needed
  - Adjust launch date if critical

**Risk 3: Scope Creep**
- **Probability**: Medium (new ideas emerge)
- **Impact**: High (schedule slip, quality reduction)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strict scope management
  - Release Manager as gatekeeper
  - Defer to v1.2.0 by default
  - Require unanimous team agreement for scope additions

**Risk 4: Critical Bug Found Late**
- **Probability**: Low (extensive testing)
- **Impact**: Critical (launch delay or rollback)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Beta testing (3-5 testers, 3 days)
  - Comprehensive test suite
  - Reserve capacity for bug fixes
  - Rollback plan ready

---

## Section 5: Workload Balancing

### Individual Capacity Tracking

**Weekly Capacity Check-In** (Every Monday):

```markdown
# Week of Jan 6 Capacity Check

## Release Manager
- Planned: 20 hours
- Actual commitment: 18 hours (90%)
- Availability: ✅ Good
- Concerns: None

## Engineering Lead
- Planned: 15 hours
- Actual commitment: 20 hours (133% - overcommitted!)
- Availability: ⚠️ Overloaded
- Concerns: Need to descope or delegate

## Engineer 1
- Planned: 10 hours
- Actual commitment: 8 hours (80%)
- Availability: ✅ Good
- Concerns: Vacation Jan 18-20 (note for Week 2)

... (continue for all team members)
```

**Workload Adjustment**:
- If anyone >100% capacity: Descope or delegate
- If anyone <50% capacity: Underutilized, find tasks
- If team average >85% capacity: Risk of burnout, reduce scope

---

### Burnout Prevention

**Warning Signs**:
- Working late nights regularly (>10 PM)
- Working weekends without breaks
- Declining code quality or communication
- Frustration or negative sentiment
- Physical symptoms (fatigue, headaches)

**Preventive Measures**:
- Limit "on-call" hours (max 8 hours/day during launch)
- Mandatory breaks (lunch, every 2 hours)
- No mandatory weekend work (except P0 emergencies)
- Celebrate small wins daily
- Check-in on team morale weekly

**Intervention**:
- If burnout signs detected:
  1. Talk to team member privately
  2. Reduce workload immediately
  3. Extend timeline if needed
  4. Adjust expectations

**Remember**: Team health > hitting dates

---

## Section 6: Meeting & Coordination Overhead

### Meeting Budget

**Daily Meetings** (Week of Jan 13-15, High intensity):
- Daily stand-up: 15 min/day (1.75 hr/week)
- Ad-hoc sync meetings: 30 min/day (3.5 hr/week)
- **Total**: 5.25 hours/week (7% of capacity)

**Weekly Meetings** (Normal periods):
- Weekly planning: 30 min (0.5 hr/week)
- Weekly retrospective: 45 min (0.75 hr/week)
- **Total**: 1.25 hours/week (1.7% of capacity)

**Target**: Keep meetings <10% of capacity

---

### Asynchronous Communication

**Prefer Async for**:
- Status updates → Discord #release channel
- Questions → Discord #engineering channel
- Decisions → GitHub issues or discussions
- Documentation → Collaborative docs (Google Docs, Notion)

**Require Sync for**:
- GO/NO-GO decisions
- Critical bug triage
- Launch coordination
- Retrospectives

**Best Practices**:
- Default to async (respect timezones/schedules)
- Sync when decision needs <1 hour
- Document sync decisions in async channels
- Record meetings for those who can't attend

---

## Section 7: External Dependencies

### Beta Testers

**Capacity Required**:
- 3-5 beta testers
- 1-2 hours each over 3 days
- Total: 12-20 tester-hours

**Availability Risk**:
- Beta testers are volunteers (may drop out)
- Mitigation: Recruit 5 testers, need 3 minimum
- Backup: Team members can supplement testing

---

### External Services

**Dependencies**:
- GitHub (for releases, CI/CD)
- Cloudflare (for CDN, if used)
- crates.io (for Rust crate publishing)
- Discord (for community)

**Contingency**:
- GitHub outage: Delay launch until restored (no alternative)
- Cloudflare outage: Direct downloads from GitHub
- crates.io outage: Binary releases only (defer crate publish)
- Discord outage: Use Twitter/email for announcements

---

## Section 8: Metrics & Reporting

### Capacity Utilization Metrics

**Track Weekly**:
```
Capacity Utilization = Actual Hours Worked / Planned Hours × 100%

Example:
- Planned: 75 hours/week
- Actual: 68 hours/week
- Utilization: 91% ✅ (good, within buffer)

Warning levels:
- <50%: Underutilized (find more tasks or reduce team size)
- 50-85%: Healthy (sustainable pace)
- 85-100%: High utilization (risky, low buffer)
- >100%: Overcommitted (reduce scope or extend timeline)
```

---

### Task Completion Rate

**Track Weekly**:
```
Task Completion Rate = Tasks Completed / Tasks Planned × 100%

Example Week 1:
- Planned: 25 tasks
- Completed: 22 tasks
- Completion Rate: 88% ✅ (good)

Warning levels:
- <70%: Behind schedule (descope or extend)
- 70-90%: On track (normal variance)
- 90-100%: Ahead of schedule (rare, validate quality)
- >100%: Scope creep (planned tasks increased mid-week)
```

---

### Burnout Risk Score

**Self-Assessment** (Weekly, anonymous survey):

```
Rate 1-5 (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree):
1. I feel energized and motivated ___
2. I have time for breaks and rest ___
3. My workload is manageable ___
4. I'm satisfied with my work quality ___
5. I'm excited about the release ___

Burnout Risk Score = (25 - Total) / 25 × 100%

Interpretation:
- 0-20%: Healthy (good morale, sustainable)
- 20-40%: Caution (monitor, adjust if worsening)
- 40-60%: Warning (reduce workload immediately)
- 60%+: Critical (intervention required, consider delay)
```

**Team Average**: Track weekly, alert if >30%

---
