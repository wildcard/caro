Built in Rust, works offline, privacy-first (optional telemetry with ZERO PII).

**What I'm Looking For**:
- 5 days of testing (Jan 13-17, ~30 min/day)
- Try it with your real workflows
- Report bugs and feedback
- Help shape the final release

**Why You?**
[Personalize: "You're a [macOS/Linux] power user who works with [domain]" or "Your CLI expertise would provide valuable insights"]

**What's In It For You?**

- Public acknowledgment as a beta tester
- My eternal gratitude! 🙏

**Interested?**
Reply with:
1. Your platform (macOS/Linux)
2. Experience level (novice/intermediate/expert with CLI)
3. Confirm availability Jan 13-17

Beta testing starts Monday, Jan 13. I'll send setup instructions on Jan 12.

## Pre-Flight Phase (Jan 12)

### 10. Day 0 Setup Email

**Purpose**: Guide beta testers through setup process
**Timing**: January 12, 2026 (8:00 AM PT)
**Audience**: Beta testers
**Channel**: Email

**Template**:

```
Subject: 🔧 Caro v1.1.0 Setup Day - Get Ready for Tomorrow!

Hi [First Name],

Today's setup day! Follow these steps to prepare for beta testing starting tomorrow (Jan 13).

**🎯 Today's Goal**: Install Caro and verify it works

**⏱️ Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes

**📝 Setup Checklist**:

### Step 1: Download Caro (5 min)

**Your Platform**: [macOS/Linux]

**Download Link**: [Pre-release Binary URL for their platform]

macOS:
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/caro-project/caro/releases/download/v1.1.0-beta-preview/caro-macos-universal
chmod +x caro-macos-universal
sudo mv caro-macos-universal /usr/local/bin/caro
```

Linux:
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/caro-project/caro/releases/download/v1.1.0-beta-preview/caro-linux-x86_64
chmod +x caro-linux-x86_64
sudo mv caro-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/caro
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation (2 min)

```bash
caro --version
# Should output: caro 1.1.0-beta

caro --help
# Should show help text
```

If you see version output, you're good! ✅

### Step 3: First Run & Telemetry Choice (10 min)

```bash
caro "list files in current directory"
```

**First-Run Consent Prompt**:
You'll see a prompt about telemetry:

```
Caro collects optional telemetry to improve accuracy.

What we collect (if you opt in):
  - Commands you generate (anonymized)
  - Success/failure rates
  - Performance metrics

What we NEVER collect:
  - File paths or names
  - Personal data
  - Command output
  - Anything identifiable

Privacy guarantee: ZERO PII (personally identifiable information)
Verified by: 220+ automated tests

Enable telemetry? (y/n):
```

**Your Choice**:
- Type `y` to opt in (helps us improve Caro)
- Type `n` to opt out (totally fine!)

**For Beta Testing**:
We prefer opt-in if you're comfortable, but it's completely optional. Your feedback is valuable either way!

### Step 4: Try a Few Commands (10 min)

Test these examples:

```bash
# File operations
caro "list files modified today"
caro "find files larger than 1MB"

# System monitoring
caro "show processes using most memory"
caro "check disk usage"

# Text search
caro "find TODO in Python files"
```

Did they work? Awesome! If not, report issues in [Discord/Slack] or beta@caro.sh.

### Step 5: Explore Help & Safety (5 min)

```bash
# Help system
caro --help
caro --examples
caro --safety

# Check telemetry status
caro telemetry status
```

### Step 6: Join Communication Channel (5 min)

If you haven't already:
1. Join [Discord/Slack]: [Invite Link]
2. Introduce yourself in #caro-beta-v110
3. Share your setup status (success or issues)

### Step 7: Report Any Issues (if needed)

**Setup Issues?**
- Post in [Discord/Slack] #caro-beta-v110

**Common Issues**:
- "Command not found": Check PATH or use full path `/usr/local/bin/caro`

Subject: 🎉 Day 1: Welcome to Caro v1.1.0 Beta Testing!

Hi [First Name],

Welcome to Day 1 of beta testing! Let's make this week awesome. 🚀

**🎯 Day 1 Goals**:

1. **Get Comfortable**: Use Caro for 5-10 real tasks today
2. **Explore Features**: Try different command types
3. **Report First Impressions**: What works? What's confusing?
4. **Test Your Workflows**: Integrate Caro into your actual work

**💡 What to Focus On Today**:

### Try These Categories:

**File Management**:
```bash
caro "list files modified today"
caro "find files larger than 10MB"
caro "show hidden files"
```

**System Monitoring**:
```bash
caro "show processes using most memory"
caro "check disk usage"
caro "find processes on port 8080"
```

**Text Processing**:
```bash
caro "find ERROR in log files"
caro "count lines in Python files"
caro "search for TODO comments"
```

**Git Operations** (if applicable):
```bash
caro "show recent commits"
caro "list modified files"
```

### Real-World Testing:

Don't just run examples! Try commands you actually need:
- "find config files in this project"
- "show running Docker containers"
- "list large files in downloads folder"

The more you use it naturally, the better feedback you'll provide!

**🐛 How to Report Issues**:

### Good Bug Report Template:

**Title**: [Brief description]

**Body**:
```
**Command**: "your natural language query"
**Platform**: macOS 14.2 / Linux Ubuntu 22.04
**Expected**: What you expected to happen

**Error Message**: [paste any errors]
**Impact**: Can't continue / Minor annoyance / Just FYI
```

**Where to Report**:
