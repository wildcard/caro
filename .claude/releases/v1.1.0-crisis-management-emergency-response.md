# Crisis Management & Emergency Response Plan

**Release**: v1.1.0-beta
**Created**: 2026-01-08
**Owner**: Release Manager
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-08
**Classification**: INTERNAL - Crisis Response Procedures

---

## Purpose

This document provides comprehensive crisis management and emergency response procedures for critical incidents during the v1.1.0-beta release lifecycle, ensuring rapid, coordinated response to protect users, maintain trust, and minimize impact.

---

## Audience

- **Primary**: Release Manager, Engineering Lead, Security Lead
- **Secondary**: Full team (for awareness and training)
- **Tertiary**: On-call engineers (reference during incidents)

---

## Crisis Definition

A **crisis** is any incident that poses significant risk to:
- **User Safety**: Dangerous commands executed, system damage
- **User Privacy**: PII exposed, data breached
- **User Security**: Vulnerabilities exploited, unauthorized access
- **Business Continuity**: Service completely unavailable, cannot recover
- **Reputation**: Widespread negative press, loss of trust

**Key Distinction**: Not all P0 incidents are crises. Crises require coordinated organizational response beyond technical fixes.

---

## Section 1: Crisis Classification

### Crisis Levels

**Level 1 - Critical Crisis** (Organizational Threat):
- **Examples**: PII breach affecting all users, dangerous command caused data loss for multiple users, security vulnerability actively exploited
- **Impact**: Existential threat to project, legal liability, severe reputation damage
- **Response Team**: Full team + external advisors (legal, security, PR)
- **Communication**: Immediate public disclosure, hourly updates
- **Resolution Time**: Drop everything, 24/7 response until resolved

**Level 2 - Major Crisis** (Significant Threat):
- **Examples**: Privacy violation affecting subset of users, security vulnerability discovered but not exploited, widespread service outage
- **Impact**: Major disruption, significant reputation risk, potential legal exposure
- **Response Team**: Core team (Release Mgr, Eng Lead, Sec Lead, Comm Lead)
- **Communication**: Public disclosure within 4 hours, every 4 hours updates
- **Resolution Time**: Prioritize above all else, 12-18 hour days until resolved

**Level 3 - Minor Crisis** (Contained Threat):
- **Examples**: Isolated privacy leak, minor security issue with mitigation, temporary outage
- **Impact**: Limited disruption, manageable reputation risk, low legal exposure
- **Response Team**: Technical leads (Eng Lead, Sec Lead)
- **Communication**: Affected users notified within 8 hours, daily updates
- **Resolution Time**: High priority, normal working hours plus on-call

## Section 2: Crisis Response Framework

### OODA Loop for Crisis Response

**Observe → Orient → Decide → Act** (Repeat continuously)

```
OBSERVE (Minutes 0-5):
- What happened?
- When did it happen?
- How many users affected?
- What's the evidence?
- Is it still happening?

ORIENT (Minutes 5-15):
- What's the severity? (L1/L2/L3)
- What are the risks?
- What are our options?
- What resources do we need?
- What's the timeline?

DECIDE (Minutes 15-20):
- What's our strategy? (Fix, rollback, disable feature, etc.)
- Who owns what?
- What's our communication plan?
- What's our success criteria?

ACT (Minutes 20+):
- Execute the plan
- Communicate status
- Monitor progress
- Adjust as needed

REPEAT: Reassess every 30-60 minutes
```
