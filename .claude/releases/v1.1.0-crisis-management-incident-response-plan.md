## Overview

### What is This Plan?

This document defines our **crisis management and incident response procedures** for handling critical issues that arise during or after the v1.1.0-beta release. It ensures we respond quickly, transparently, and effectively to protect users and maintain trust.

### When to Use This Plan

**Use this plan when**:
- Critical bug affects most or all users (P0)
- Security vulnerability discovered or exploited
- Privacy violation detected (PII leaked)
- Infrastructure failure (GitHub, Discord, downloads unavailable)
- Reputational crisis (negative viral post, coordinated attack)

**Don't use for**:
- Normal bugs (P1/P2/P3) → Use standard issue triage
- Feature requests → Use GitHub Discussions
- User questions → Use Discord #support

### Guiding Principles

1. **User Safety First**: Protect users before reputation
2. **Transparency**: Honest, timely communication
3. **Speed**: Act fast, fix fast, communicate fast
4. **Learn**: Every incident is a learning opportunity
5. **No Blame**: Focus on fixing, not blaming

---

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### P0: Critical (Drop Everything)

**Definition**: Complete product failure, data loss, security breach, or privacy violation

**Examples**:
- Caro crashes on launch for all users
- Security vulnerability actively exploited
- PII leaked in telemetry (privacy violation)
- Dangerous command executed without warning
- Binary compromised or malware detected

**Response Time**:
- Acknowledge: < 1 hour
- Public update: < 2 hours
- Fix: < 24 hours (hotfix release)

**Impact**: Affects majority of users or poses serious risk

**Escalation**: Immediate - notify entire team

---

#### P1: High (Urgent, Not Emergency)

**Definition**: Major functionality broken, affects core use cases

**Examples**:
- Command generation fails for major category (e.g., all file commands)
- Platform-specific critical failure (e.g., all Linux installs fail)
- Performance degradation (>10 second response times)
- Safety validation not working (dangerous commands not blocked)

**Response Time**:
- Acknowledge: < 4 hours
- Public update: < 8 hours
- Fix: < 3 days

**Impact**: Affects significant subset of users or core functionality

**Escalation**: Same-day - notify Lead Developer and Release Manager

---

#### P2: Medium (Important, Not Urgent)

**Definition**: Minor functionality broken, workaround exists

**Examples**:
- Specific edge case fails (e.g., files with spaces in names)
- Performance issue (2-3 second delays)
- Confusing error messages
- Documentation gaps

**Response Time**:
- Acknowledge: < 1 day
- Fix: Next release (v1.1.1 or v1.2.0)

**Impact**: Affects small subset of users, workaround available

**Escalation**: Next business day

---

#### P3: Low (Nice to Fix)

**Definition**: Cosmetic issues, minor inconveniences

**Examples**:
- Typos in help text
- Formatting inconsistencies
- Feature requests

**Response Time**:
- Acknowledge: < 2 days
- Fix: Future release (when convenient)

**Impact**: Minimal user impact

**Escalation**: None

## Incident Response Process

### Step 1: Detection & Triage (0-15 minutes)

**How Incidents are Detected**:
- User reports (GitHub, Discord, Twitter)
- Monitoring alerts (if automated)
- Team member observation
- Security researcher disclosure

**Triage Questions**:
1. **What is broken?** (specific symptom)
2. **How many users are affected?** (all, many, some, few)
3. **What is the risk?** (data loss, security, privacy, availability)
4. **Is this confirmed?** (reproduced by team member)

**Outcome**: Severity classification (P0/P1/P2/P3)

---

### Step 2: Incident Declaration (15-30 minutes)

**For P0 Incidents**:

1. **Declare Incident**: IC announces in team chat
   ```
   🚨 P0 INCIDENT DECLARED 🚨

   **What**: [Brief description]
   **Impact**: [Scope of impact]
   **Severity**: P0 - Critical
   **IC**: [Name]
   **War Room**: [Slack/Discord channel or call link]

   ALL HANDS - Join war room immediately.
   ```

2. **Assemble Team**:
   - IC (Incident Commander)
   - Technical Lead
   - Communications Lead
   - Other engineers as needed

3. **Create War Room**:
   - Dedicated Slack/Discord channel: `#incident-YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Or video call for real-time coordination

---

### Step 3: Assess & Investigate (30 min - 2 hours)

**Objectives**:
- Confirm severity and scope
- Identify root cause
- Assess risk (security, privacy, data loss)
- Determine fix approach

**Key Questions**:
1. **Scope**: How many users? Which platforms? All use cases or specific?
2. **Root Cause**: What broke? When did it break? Why?
3. **Risk**: Security risk? Privacy risk? Data loss risk?
4. **Fix**: Quick fix available? Hotfix needed? Rollback needed?

**Output**: Incident assessment document

---

### Step 4: Communicate (1-2 hours from detection)

## Communication Protocols

### Communication Channels by Incident Type

| Incident Type | Primary | Secondary | Tertiary |
|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| P0 Product Failure | Discord #announcements | Twitter | GitHub (pinned issue) |
| P0 Security | GitHub Security Advisory | Discord | Twitter |
| P0 Privacy | Email (affected users) | Discord | Twitter |
| P1 High Priority | GitHub Issue | Discord #announcements | Twitter |
| Infrastructure | Twitter | Discord #announcements | GitHub (if available) |

---

### Communication Tone & Style

**Principles**:
- **Honest**: Don't sugarcoat, don't hide
- **Clear**: Use simple language, avoid jargon
- **Empathetic**: Acknowledge user frustration
- **Actionable**: Tell users what to do
- **Accountable**: Own mistakes, don't blame

**Good Example**:
```
We messed up. Our privacy validation missed a case, and [PII type] was included in telemetry.

We've:
- Fixed the code
- Deleted all PII
- Added extra checks

We're deeply sorry. We'll do better.

Update now: brew upgrade caro
```

**Bad Example**:
```
Due to an unforeseen edge case in our validation pipeline, certain metadata fields inadvertently included user-identifying information.

We have implemented enhanced validation procedures to mitigate future occurrences.
```

(Too corporate, not accountable, not actionable)
