## Final Thoughts

This is more than a software release. It's the beginning of a movement toward:
- **Privacy-first AI** that respects users
- **Developer empowerment** through better tools
- **Community-driven OSS** that's sustainable

We've built something technically excellent, thoroughly documented, and ready to serve users. The hard work of 136 documents, thousands of lines of code, and countless hours of testing has prepared us for this moment.

**Let's ship v1.1.0-beta and change how developers interact with the command line.**
