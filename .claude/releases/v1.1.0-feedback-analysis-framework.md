**Metrics to Calculate**:

1. **Overall Satisfaction Score**:
   ```
   Average of all satisfaction ratings (1-5 scale)
   Target: ≥4.0
   ```

2. **Daily Engagement Rate**:
   ```
   (Users who used Caro today / Total active beta testers) × 100
   Target: ≥80%
   ```

3. **Issue Discovery Rate**:
   ```
   New issues reported per day
   Lower is better (suggests product stability)
   ```

4. **Issue Resolution Rate**:
   ```
   (Issues closed / Issues opened) × 100
   Target: ≥90%
   ```

5. **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** (from final survey):
   ```
   % Promoters (9-10) - % Detractors (0-6)
   Target: ≥50 (good), ≥70 (excellent)
   ```

6. **Command Success Rate** (from telemetry):
   ```
   (Successful commands / Total commands) × 100
   Target: ≥85%
   ```

---

### Qualitative Analysis

**Thematic Coding Process**:

1. **Read All Feedback**: Review all text responses from surveys, issues, Discord, emails

2. **Identify Themes**: Look for recurring topics, concerns, praises

3. **Code Feedback**: Tag each piece of feedback with 1-3 themes

4. **Count Theme Frequency**: How often does each theme appear?

5. **Prioritize Themes**: Which themes are most common and most important?

**Common Themes to Track**:
- Installation ease
- Command accuracy
- Platform compatibility
- Error message clarity
- Documentation quality
- Performance/speed
- Safety warnings
- Telemetry concerns
- Feature gaps
- Workflow integration

---

### Sentiment Analysis

**Manual Sentiment Scoring**:

For each feedback item, assign sentiment score:
- **+2**: Very positive (enthusiastic praise)
- **+1**: Positive (satisfied, appreciative)
- **0**: Neutral (factual, no emotion)
- **-1**: Negative (frustrated, disappointed)
- **-2**: Very negative (angry, threatening to abandon)

**Calculate Average Sentiment**:
```
Average sentiment = Sum of all scores / Number of feedback items
Target: ≥+0.5 (more positive than negative)
```

---

## Priority Scoring Framework

### How to Prioritize Feedback for Action

Not all feedback can be acted on immediately. Use this framework to score and prioritize.

**Priority Score Formula**:
```
Priority Score = Impact × Frequency × Effort

Where:
- Impact: How much does this improve user experience? (1-5)
- Frequency: How many users mentioned this? (1-5)
- Effort: How easy is this to implement? (5 = easy, 1 = hard)

Higher score = Higher priority
```

---

### Impact Scale (1-5)

**5 - Critical**: Blocks core use case, major pain point
- Examples: Installation failure, core feature broken, dangerous commands not caught

**4 - High**: Significant friction for many users
- Examples: Slow performance, confusing errors, platform incompatibility

**3 - Medium**: Moderate improvement to experience
- Examples: Feature gap, minor UI improvement, better docs

**2 - Low**: Nice-to-have, small improvement
- Examples: Cosmetic changes, edge case handling, advanced feature requests

**1 - Minimal**: Negligible impact on most users
- Examples: Personal preferences, niche use cases

---

### Frequency Scale (1-5)

**5 - Very High**: >50% of users mentioned this
**4 - High**: 30-50% of users
**3 - Medium**: 10-30% of users
**2 - Low**: 5-10% of users
**1 - Very Low**: <5% of users (1-2 mentions)

---

### Effort Scale (5-1, inverted so higher is better)

**5 - Very Easy**: <1 hour (doc update, config change)
**4 - Easy**: 1-4 hours (small code change, single file)
**3 - Medium**: 1-2 days (feature addition, multi-file change)
**2 - Hard**: 3-5 days (architecture change, significant refactor)
**1 - Very Hard**: 1+ weeks (major feature, requires research/design)

---

### Priority Calculation Example

**Feedback**: "Error messages are confusing and don't help me fix the problem"

**Scoring**:
- **Impact**: 4 (High - significant friction)
- **Frequency**: 4 (High - 40% of users mentioned this)
- **Effort**: 4 (Easy - improve error messages in existing code)

**Priority Score**: 4 × 4 × 4 = **64**

---

**Feedback**: "Add support for Windows PowerShell commands"

**Scoring**:
- **Impact**: 3 (Medium - would expand user base)
- **Frequency**: 1 (Very Low - only 1 user asked)
- **Effort**: 1 (Very Hard - requires Windows support, new backend)

**Priority Score**: 3 × 1 × 1 = **3**

---

**Interpretation**:
- **Score >50**: High priority, address in current release
- **Score 20-50**: Medium priority, consider for next release
- **Score <20**: Low priority, backlog for future

---
