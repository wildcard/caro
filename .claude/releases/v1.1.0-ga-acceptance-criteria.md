## CRITICAL Acceptance Criteria (ALL Must Pass)

### C1: Zero Privacy Violations ✅ BLOCKING

**Requirement**: No personally identifiable information (PII) collected in telemetry

**Verification**:

  jq '.events[] | select(.username != null)' "$export"

  # Check for email addresses (should be EMPTY)
  jq '.events[] | .[] | select(type == "string") | select(test("@"))' "$export"
done
```

**Acceptance**:
- ✅ ZERO occurrences of PII in any export

- ✅ All 220+ privacy tests passing

**Failure Action**: BLOCK release, fix validation layer, re-test completely

---

### C2: Zero P0 Bugs ✅ BLOCKING
