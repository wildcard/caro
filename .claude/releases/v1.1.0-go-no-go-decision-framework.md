## Gate Overview

### Five Critical Gates

| Gate | Date | Purpose | Decision Maker |
|------|------|---------|----------------|
| **Gate 1: Pre-Beta** | Jan 12, 2026 (5 PM) | Ready to start beta? | Release Manager |
| **Gate 2: Beta Launch** | Jan 13, 2026 (8 AM) | Can we onboard testers? | Release Manager |
| **Gate 3: Beta Exit** | Jan 18, 2026 (5 PM) | Beta successful enough? | Release Manager + Lead Dev |
| **Gate 4: Release** | Jan 23, 2026 (5 PM) | Ready to release publicly? | Release Manager + Leadership |
| **Gate 5: GA Release** | Feb 14, 2026 (5 PM) | Ready to remove beta label? | Release Manager + Leadership |

### Decision Principles

**1. Data-Driven**: All decisions based on measurable criteria, not gut feelings

**2. Conservative**: When in doubt, NO-GO. Better to delay than release broken software

**3. Transparent**: Document rationale publicly (except sensitive info)

**4. Collaborative**: Release Manager makes call, but with input from team

**5. Reversible**: If we GO and discover issues, we can pause/rollback

---

## Gate 1: Pre-Beta GO/NO-GO

**Decision Point**: Sunday, January 12, 2026 at 5:00 PM

**Question**: Are we ready to launch beta testing on Monday, January 13?

---

### BLOCKING Criteria (ALL must pass)

#### 1. Privacy Validation

**Requirement**: **ZERO PII** in telemetry exports

**How to Validate**:
```bash
# Run comprehensive privacy test suite
cargo test privacy -- --nocapture

# Must show: ALL TESTS PASSED

# Manual validation
caro telemetry export pre-beta-test.json
scripts/privacy_audit.sh pre-beta-test.json

# Must show: ✅ ZERO PII VIOLATIONS
```

**Decision**:
- ✅ GO if: Zero PII violations in both automated tests and manual audit
- ❌ NO-GO if: Any PII detected (email, file paths, IP addresses, etc.)

**Who Validates**: Lead Developer + Release Manager (independent validation)

**Fallback**: If NO-GO, delay beta to Jan 14 or 15 to fix privacy issues

---

#### 2. Static Matcher Performance

**Requirement**: Overall pass rate ≥75% (current: 86.2%)

**How to Validate**:
```bash
# Run full static matcher test suite
cargo test static_matcher -- --nocapture

# Check pass rate
# Current: 58 tests, 50 passing = 86.2%

# Must maintain: ≥75% (44+ of 58 tests passing)
```

**Decision**:
- ✅ GO if: Pass rate ≥75% (we're at 86.2%, well above threshold)
- ❌ NO-GO if: Pass rate <75% (significant regression)

**Who Validates**: Lead Developer

**Fallback**: If NO-GO (unexpected regression), investigate root cause and fix before launching beta

---

#### 3. Installation Scripts Work

**Requirement**: Installation succeeds on macOS and Linux

**How to Validate**:
```bash
# macOS validation
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://install.caro-cli.dev)"
caro --version  # Should show: caro 1.1.0-beta
caro "list files"  # Should generate command

# Linux validation (Ubuntu/Debian)
wget https://github.com/your-org/caro/releases/download/v1.1.0-beta/caro_1.1.0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i caro_1.1.0_amd64.deb
caro --version  # Should show: caro 1.1.0-beta
caro "list files"  # Should generate command
```

**Decision**:
- ✅ GO if: Installation succeeds on BOTH platforms, `caro --version` works, basic command generation works
- ❌ NO-GO if: Installation fails on either platform, or binary doesn't run

**Who Validates**: QA Engineer (fresh VM testing)

**Fallback**: If NO-GO, fix installation scripts and re-test

---

#### 4. Beta Tester Recruitment

**Requirement**: ≥3 confirmed beta testers (target: 3-5)

**How to Validate**:
```bash
# Check recruitment spreadsheet
# Count testers with status: "Accepted - Confirmed"

# Minimum: 3 testers
# Preferred: 5 testers
# Diversity: At least 1 macOS, 1 Linux
```

**Decision**:
- ✅ GO if: ≥3 confirmed testers, with platform diversity (1 macOS + 1 Linux minimum)
- ❌ NO-GO if: <3 confirmed testers, or only 1 platform represented

**Who Validates**: Release Manager

**Fallback**: If NO-GO, extend recruitment to Jan 13 morning, or delay beta start to Jan 14

---

#### 5. Documentation Ready

**Requirement**: Key docs published and accessible

**How to Validate**:
```bash
# Check these files exist and are up to date:

- .claude/releases/v1.1.0-known-issues.md (empty or with known issues)

# Check GitHub Pages or docs site is live
```

**Decision**:
- ✅ GO if: All critical docs exist, accurate, and accessible
- ❌ NO-GO if: Missing critical docs or major inaccuracies

**Who Validates**: Support Engineer

**Fallback**: If NO-GO, complete docs and re-evaluate (minor delay acceptable)

---

### IMPORTANT Criteria (Should pass, but not blocking)

#### 6. Safety Pattern Coverage

**Target**: 100+ safety patterns active

**How to Validate**:
```bash
# Count safety patterns
cargo test safety_patterns -- --nocapture | grep "PATTERNS"

# Current: 100+ patterns
# Target: Maintain 100+
```

**Decision**:
- ✅ Preferred: 100+ patterns
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 80-99 patterns (document gaps)
- ❌ Concerning: <80 patterns (but not blocking)

**Impact**: If <100, document known safety gaps in known-issues.md

---

#### 7. Telemetry System Functional

**Target**: Telemetry opt-in/opt-out works, export succeeds

**How to Validate**:
```bash
# Test telemetry workflow
caro telemetry enable
caro telemetry status  # Should show: enabled
caro "test command"
caro telemetry export test.json  # Should succeed
caro telemetry disable
caro telemetry status  # Should show: disabled
```

**Decision**:
- ✅ Preferred: All telemetry functions work
- ⚠️ Acceptable: Minor bugs (e.g., slow export)
- ❌ Concerning: Telemetry completely broken (but not blocking)

---

## Gate 3: Beta Exit GO/NO-GO

**Decision Point**: Saturday, January 18, 2026 at 5:00 PM

**Question**: Was beta testing successful enough to proceed to release?

---

### BLOCKING Criteria (ALL must pass)

#### 1. Zero P0 Bugs

**Requirement**: No critical bugs discovered during beta

**How to Validate**:
```bash
# Review all GitHub issues labeled "bug-p0-critical"
# Count: Must be ZERO unresolved P0 bugs

# If any P0 bugs were found and fixed, verify:
#   - Fix deployed
#   - Original reporter confirmed fix
#   - No new P0 bugs introduced by fix
```

**Decision**:
- ✅ GO if: Zero unresolved P0 bugs
- ❌ NO-GO if: Any unresolved P0 bugs

**Who Validates**: Release Manager + Lead Developer

**Fallback**: If NO-GO, delay release to fix P0 bugs. Extend beta if needed.

---

#### 2. Command Success Rate ≥85%

**Requirement**: From telemetry data, command generation succeeds ≥85% of time

**How to Validate**:
```bash
# Aggregate all beta tester telemetry exports
scripts/aggregate_telemetry.sh beta-exports/*.json > beta-summary.json

# Calculate success rate
# success_rate = successful_commands / total_commands

# Target: ≥85%
```

**Decision**:
- ✅ GO if: Success rate ≥85%
- ⚠️ CONDITIONAL GO if: Success rate 75-84% (document known gaps, proceed with caution)
- ❌ NO-GO if: Success rate <75% (product not ready)

**Who Validates**: Lead Developer (analysis) + Release Manager (decision)

**Fallback**: If NO-GO, identify top failure categories, implement fixes, consider extended beta or delay release

---

#### 3. User Satisfaction ≥4.0/5.0

**Requirement**: Average satisfaction rating from final surveys ≥4.0

**How to Validate**:
```bash
# Compile final survey responses
# Calculate average of "Overall satisfaction" question (1-5 scale)

# Target: ≥4.0 average
```

**Decision**:
- ✅ GO if: Satisfaction ≥4.0/5.0
- ⚠️ CONDITIONAL GO if: Satisfaction 3.5-3.9 (document concerns, analyze feedback)
- ❌ NO-GO if: Satisfaction <3.5 (significant UX problems)

**Who Validates**: Release Manager (compile responses) + Product Team (analyze)

**Fallback**: If NO-GO, analyze low satisfaction causes, implement urgent fixes, consider extended beta

---

### IMPORTANT Criteria (Should pass, inform decision)

#### 4. Tester Engagement

**How to Validate**:
```bash
# Track tester participation
# Check:
#   - Daily check-in responses (5 days)
#   - Final survey completion
#   - Telemetry exports received

# Calculate engagement rate:
# engaged_testers / total_testers

# Target: ≥80%
```

**Decision Impact**:
- ✅ ≥80%: High confidence in feedback quality
- ⚠️ 60-79%: Moderate confidence, some data gaps
- ❌ <60%: Low confidence, feedback may not be representative

**Impact**: Low engagement suggests we may not have comprehensive feedback, but not blocking if other metrics pass

---

#### 5. P1 Bug Count

**Target**: ≤2 unresolved P1 bugs

**How to Validate**:
```bash
# Review all GitHub issues labeled "bug-p1-high"
# Count: Unresolved P1 bugs

# Target: ≤2
```

**Decision Impact**:
- ✅ ≤2 P1 bugs: Acceptable
- ⚠️ 3-5 P1 bugs: Concerning, but potentially acceptable if fixes planned
- ❌ >5 P1 bugs: Product quality concerns

**Impact**: High P1 count suggests instability, but not blocking if fixes are in flight

---

### Beta Exit Decision

**Final Decision (Jan 18, 5:00 PM)**:

**GO Criteria**:
```
✅ BLOCKING #1: Zero P0 bugs
✅ BLOCKING #2: Command success rate ≥85% (or 75-84% with documented gaps)

## Decision-Making Process

### Roles & Responsibilities

**Release Manager**:
- Primary decision-maker for Gates 1, 2
- Joint decision-maker for Gates 3, 4, 5
- Gathers data, synthesizes information
- Conducts decision meetings
- Documents and communicates decisions

**Lead Developer**:
- Technical validation for all gates
- Joint decision-maker for Gates 3, 4, 5
- Provides engineering recommendations
- Assesses technical risks

**Engineering Leadership**:
- Joint decision-maker for Gates 4, 5

- Executive sign-off for major decisions
- Escalation resolution

**Product Team**:
- User satisfaction analysis
- Feature readiness assessment
- Market timing considerations

**QA Engineer**:
- Test validation for all gates
- Quality metrics reporting
- Risk assessment

---

### Decision Meeting Format

**Pre-Meeting** (24 hours before decision):
1. Release Manager compiles all metrics
2. Each criterion assessed: PASS/FAIL
3. Summary document circulated to decision-makers

**Decision Meeting** (1 hour):
1. **Metrics Review** (15 min): Walk through all criteria
2. **Discussion** (20 min): Debate borderline cases, assess risks
3. **Recommendations** (10 min): Each decision-maker shares view
4. **Decision** (10 min): Release Manager or highest-ranking participant makes final call
5. **Communication Plan** (5 min): Who communicates what, when

**Post-Meeting** (immediate):
1. Document decision + rationale
2. Communicate to team (Slack, email)
3. Communicate to community if appropriate (GitHub, Discord)

---

### Handling Disagreement

**If Decision-Makers Disagree**:

1. **Clarify Criteria**: Are we interpreting criteria differently?
2. **Assess Risk**: What's the worst case if we GO? If we NO-GO?
3. **Seek Data**: Can we gather more data to resolve disagreement?
4. **Escalate**: If no consensus, escalate to Engineering Leadership or executive team
5. **Default Conservative**: When in doubt, NO-GO is safer than GO

**Veto Power**:
- Any decision-maker can raise a "strong objection" that requires escalation
- Release Manager has final call for Gates 1-2
- Engineering Leadership has final call for Gates 4-5

---

## Escalation Procedures

### When to Escalate
