## Purpose

This document defines the knowledge management and documentation strategy for v1.1.0-beta release, ensuring all critical knowledge is captured, organized, and accessible for current team members, future releases, new contributors, and long-term project sustainability.

---

## Audience

- **Primary**: Release Manager, Documentation Lead
- **Secondary**: Full team (contributors and consumers)
- **Tertiary**: Future maintainers, new contributors

---

## Core Principles

1. **Documentation as Code**: Version-controlled, reviewed, tested
2. **Single Source of Truth**: No duplicate or conflicting docs
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Right level of detail for each audience
4. **Discoverability**: Easy to find what you need
5. **Currency**: Keep docs up-to-date or mark as outdated

### Example ADRs for v1.1.0-beta

**ADR-001: Use Embedded ML Models Over API-Only Backends**

**Context**: Need to decide between embedded models (SmolLM, Qwen) vs API-only (OpenAI, Anthropic) for command generation.

**Decision**: Support both, but prioritize embedded models as default with API as fallback.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Positive: Works offline, faster, privacy-friendly, no API costs
- ❌ Negative: Larger binary size, slower inference than GPT-4, need model files
- 🔄 Neutral: Can switch backends via config

**Alternatives**:
- API-only: Rejected (requires internet, costs money, privacy concerns)
- Embedded-only: Rejected (quality limitations for complex queries)

---

**ADR-002: Use Static Pattern Matching Before LLM Fallback**

**Context**: LLM inference is slow (450ms p95) compared to static matching (<50ms). Should we always use LLM or optimize with static patterns?

**Decision**: Implement static pattern matcher for common queries, fallback to LLM for complex ones.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Positive: 10x faster for common queries (68% of traffic), deterministic output, no LLM errors
- ❌ Negative: Maintenance burden (need to update patterns), less flexible than pure LLM
- 🔄 Neutral: Hybrid complexity (two systems to maintain)

**Alternatives**:
- LLM-only: Rejected (too slow for common queries)
- Static-only: Rejected (can't handle complex queries)

```markdown
# Caro - Natural Language to Shell Commands

Generate safe, platform-aware shell commands from natural language.

## Quick Start

# Install
curl -fsSL https://get.caro.sh | sh

# Use
caro "list files in current directory"
# Output: ls -la
```

## Features

- 🚀 Fast: Static patterns for common queries (<100ms)
- 🛡️ Safe: 100+ dangerous command patterns blocked
- 🔒 Private: Zero PII in telemetry, opt-in by default
- 🍎 Apple Silicon: MLX backend for M1/M2/M3 Macs
- 🐧 Linux: Optimized for common distributions

## Installation

[Detailed instructions for macOS, Linux, from source]

## Usage

[Examples for common scenarios]

## Configuration

[How to configure backends, telemetry, etc.]

### User Guides

**Structure** (`/docs/guides/`):
- `getting-started.md`: First 5 minutes with Caro
- `common-tasks.md`: File management, process monitoring, system info
- `configuration.md`: Backends, telemetry, advanced settings
- `troubleshooting.md`: Common errors and solutions
- `safety.md`: How safety validation works, what's blocked
- `privacy.md`: What we collect, how to control it

**Example: Getting Started Guide**

```markdown
# Getting Started with Caro

This guide will help you get started with Caro in 5 minutes.

## 1. Installation (1 minute)

**macOS or Linux**:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.caro.sh | sh
```

**From source** (if you have Rust installed):
```bash
cargo install caro
```

## 2. Your First Command (1 minute)

```bash
caro "list files in current directory"
```

**Output**:
```
ls -la
```

Caro generates the command but doesn't execute it. You can:
- Copy and paste it to execute
- Pipe to shell: `caro "list files" | sh` (be careful!)

## 3. Try More Commands (3 minutes)

**File management**:
```bash
caro "find files larger than 100MB"
caro "show disk usage"
```

**Process monitoring**:
```bash
caro "show running processes"
caro "show top memory consumers"
```

**System information**:
```bash
caro "show system information"
caro "check CPU usage"
```

## 4. Configure (Optional)

**Change backend**:
```bash
caro config backend --set embedded  # Use embedded model (default)
caro config backend --set ollama    # Use Ollama (if installed)
```

**Enable telemetry** (helps us improve, zero PII):
```bash
caro config telemetry --enable
```

## 5. Get Help

```bash
caro --help           # Show all commands
caro config --help    # Show config options
```

**Need more help?**
- [FAQ](faq.md)
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/caro)

## Next Steps

- Read [Common Tasks](common-tasks.md) for more examples
- Learn about [Safety](safety.md) and what commands are blocked
- Understand [Privacy](privacy.md) and our data practices
```

## Section 7: Knowledge Sharing

### Documentation Reviews

**Peer Review Process**:
1. Author writes documentation
2. Creates pull request (docs treated like code)
3. Requests review from 1-2 relevant people
4. Reviewers check:
   - Accuracy (technically correct?)
   - Clarity (easy to understand?)
   - Completeness (covers the topic?)
   - Currency (up-to-date?)
5. Author addresses feedback
6. Merge when approved

**Documentation Standards**:
- Use active voice: "Run the command" not "The command is run"
- Use present tense: "Caro generates" not "Caro will generate"
- Use examples: Show, don't just tell
- Use consistent terminology
- Keep sentences <25 words
- Use headings for scannability

---

### Knowledge Transfer

**New Team Member Onboarding**:

**Week 1**:
- Read README, architecture docs
- Install Caro, try common commands
- Review 5 most important release docs
- Attend team sync meeting

**Week 2**:
- Deep-dive on one area (backend, safety, etc.)
- Pair with team member on small task
- Ask questions (document answers)
- Contribute small documentation fix

**Week 3**:
- Take on first solo task
- Attend retrospective
- Shadow on-call engineer
- Write learning summary

**Week 4**:
- Independent contribution
- Teach something to team
- Update onboarding docs with learnings

---

### Documentation Metrics

**Track Monthly**:
```
Documentation Coverage = Pages with docs / Total pages × 100%

Example:
- Total public functions: 50
- Functions with Rustdoc: 45
- Coverage: 90% ✅

Target: ≥80% overall, 100% for public API
```

**Documentation Quality Survey** (Quarterly):
```
Rate documentation 1-5:
1. Easy to find what I need? ___
2. Accurate and up-to-date? ___
3. Clear and understandable? ___
4. Has useful examples? ___
5. Covers necessary topics? ___

Average Score: ___ / 5
Target: ≥4/5
```

**End of Knowledge Management & Documentation Strategy**

This strategy ensures all critical release knowledge is captured, organized, and accessible for current team members, future releases, new contributors, and long-term project sustainability through comprehensive documentation practices and knowledge management processes.

**Remember**: Documentation is an investment in future productivity. Good docs save more time than they take to write.
