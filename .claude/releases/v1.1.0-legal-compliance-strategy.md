## Legal Vision

### Mission
**"Protect contributors, users, and the project through clear, permissive licensing and transparent legal practices."**

### Legal Principles
1. **Permissive**: MIT license maximizes freedom, minimal restrictions
2. **Clear**: No legal ambiguity, plain language where possible
3. **Protective**: Shield contributors from liability
4. **Compliant**: Follow all applicable laws and regulations
5. **Transparent**: Legal terms publicly documented

### Legal Goals
- Protect project from legal challenges
- Enable commercial use (no copyleft restrictions)
- Protect contributors from liability claims
- Ensure dependency license compatibility
- Maintain trademark rights

---

## Licensing Strategy

### Primary License: MIT

**Full Text**: See [LICENSE](../LICENSE)

**Why MIT**:
- **Permissive**: Allows commercial use, modification, distribution
- **Popular**: Well-understood by developers, companies, lawyers
- **Compatible**: Works with most other licenses (GPL, Apache, BSD)
- **Simple**: Easy to understand, low friction for adoption
- **Business-Friendly**: Companies can use without legal concerns

**MIT License Summary**:
```
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software...

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND...
```

**What Users Can Do**:
- Use Caro for any purpose (personal, commercial, government)
- Modify the source code
- Distribute original or modified versions
- Include Caro in proprietary software
- Relicense derivative works (under different terms)

**What Users Must Do**:
- Include copyright notice in all copies
- Include MIT license text in all copies

**What Users Don't Get**:
- No warranty (software provided "as is")
- No liability for damages (contributors not liable)

---

### License Headers

**All Source Files** (Rust, Shell, etc.):
```rust
// Copyright (c) 2026 Caro Contributors
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```

**Why SPDX**:
- Machine-readable license identifier
- Industry standard (Linux Foundation)
- Tools can automatically verify compliance

---

### Dual Licensing (Not Used)

**Why We Don't Dual License**:
- MIT already permissive (no need for commercial license)
- Simpler for users (one license to understand)
- No confusion about which license applies

**When Others Dual License**:
- GPL + Commercial (e.g., MySQL, Qt)
- Reason: Force companies to pay or open-source their code
- Caro: We want broad adoption, not monetization through licensing

---

## Contributor Agreements

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA): Not Required

**Why No CLA**:
- Friction for contributors (sign legal document, barrier to entry)
- MIT license already grants necessary rights
- Community preference (CLAs controversial in open source)

**What We Use Instead**: Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

---

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

**Purpose**: Contributors certify they have rights to submit code

**DCO Text**: https://developercertificate.org/

**Summary**:
- Contributor certifies they wrote the code OR have rights to submit it
- Contributor certifies they understand contribution is public
- Contributor certifies they provide contribution under project license (MIT)

**How Contributors Sign**:
```bash
# Add to commit message
git commit -s -m "feat: add new feature

Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane@example.com>"

# -s flag automatically adds Signed-off-by line
```

**Enforcement**:
- CI checks for Signed-off-by line
- PRs without DCO are blocked until added
- Clear instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md

**Why DCO Works**:
- Lightweight (no separate document to sign)
- Git-native (part of commit, not external system)
- Legally sufficient (used by Linux kernel, many major projects)

---

### Copyright Assignment: Not Required

**Why No Copyright Assignment**:
- Contributors retain copyright (industry norm for MIT projects)
- No single entity owns all code (decentralized)
- Simplifies contribution (no paperwork)

**Implication**:
- Project cannot relicense without ALL contributors' consent
- Fine for MIT (permissive license, unlikely to change)
- If we wanted to change to GPL: Would need permission from every contributor (impractical)

---

## Trademark Policy

### Trademarks

**Registered Trademarks** (or pending):
- "Caro" (word mark)
- Caro logo (design mark)

**Purpose**:
- Prevent confusion (others can't release "Caro" competing products)
- Protect reputation (others can't tarnish Caro brand)
- Control quality (official releases vs forks)

---

### Trademark Usage Guidelines

**Permitted Uses** (No Permission Needed):
1. **Referring to Caro**: "I use Caro for command generation"
2. **Linking to Caro**: "Download Caro at caro-cli.dev"
3. **Compatibility**: "MyTool is compatible with Caro"
4. **Educational**: "How to Install Caro (Tutorial)"

**Restricted Uses** (Permission Required):
1. **Product Names**: "Caro Pro", "Caro Enterprise" (implies official release)
2. **Domain Names**: "caro-support.com", "get-caro.net" (implies affiliation)
3. **Company Names**: "Caro Inc.", "Caro Solutions" (implies ownership)
4. **Modified Versions**: Distributing modified Caro under "Caro" name

**How to Request Permission**:
- Email: legal@caro-cli.dev
- Describe intended use
- Response within 2 weeks

---

### Forking and Rebranding

**Forks Are Allowed** (Open Source):
- Anyone can fork Caro (MIT license permits)
- Must remove "Caro" trademarks from fork
- Must clearly indicate it's a fork, not official

**Example Fork**:
```
❌ Bad: "Caro Plus" (implies official)
✅ Good: "CommandGen (based on Caro)" (clear it's a fork)
```

**Logo and Brand**:
- Forks must not use Caro logo
- Forks must create distinct visual identity
- Rationale: Prevent user confusion

---

## Privacy Compliance

### GDPR (European Union)

**Applicability**: If Caro collects personal data from EU residents

**Caro's Approach**: Privacy by Design
- **No PII Collection**: Caro does not collect names, emails, IPs, file paths
- **Opt-In Telemetry**: Telemetry disabled by default, users must enable
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect what's necessary (command categories, not content)
- **Right to Access**: Users can export telemetry: `caro telemetry export`
- **Right to Deletion**: Users can delete telemetry: `caro telemetry clear`

**GDPR Compliance**:
- ✅ No PII = Minimal GDPR obligations
- ✅ Opt-in = User consent obtained
- ✅ Export/delete = Data portability and erasure rights

**Data Processing Agreement**: Not needed (no data processors, local-only tool)

---

### CCPA (California)

**Applicability**: If Caro "sells" personal information of California residents

**Caro's Status**: Not applicable
- Caro does not sell data (no monetization of user data)
- Caro does not share data with third parties
- Local-only tool (no data transmission)

---

### Privacy Policy

**Required**: If collecting any user data (even anonymized)

**Caro Privacy Policy**: See [PRIVACY.md](../PRIVACY.md)

**Contents**:
1. What data we collect (command categories, timestamps, platform)
2. How we collect it (opt-in telemetry)
3. Why we collect it (improve accuracy)
4. Who has access (project maintainers only)
5. How users control it (export, delete, opt-out)
6. Data retention (indefinite, but users can delete anytime)
7. Security measures (encrypted in transit, local storage)
8. Contact info (privacy@caro-cli.dev)

---

## Export Control

### U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR)

**Applicability**: Software distributed from U.S. or developed by U.S. persons

**Caro's Classification**:
- **ECCN**: 5D002 (publicly available encryption software)
- **License Exception**: TSU (Technology and Software Unrestricted)
- **Reasoning**: Open source, publicly available, no encryption restrictions

**Practical Implication**:
- Caro can be exported to most countries
- Restricted countries: North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Syria, Crimea (U.S. embargoes)
- No export license required for open source

**Compliance**:
- Include export control notice in README
- Block downloads from embargoed countries (if technically feasible)

**Export Notice**:
```
## Export Control

Caro may be subject to U.S. export control laws. By downloading or using
Caro, you represent that you are not located in, or under the control of,
any country subject to U.S. embargo.
```

---

### Cryptography Notice

**Does Caro Use Cryptography**: Minimal (TLS for potential future updates)

**Encryption Registration**:
- If strong encryption (>64-bit): May need to notify U.S. BIS
- Caro: Only uses standard HTTPS (TLS) for update checks (future feature)
- Open source exemption likely applies

---

## Dependency Licensing

### License Compatibility

**Caro's License**: MIT (permissive)

**Compatible Licenses** (Can use as dependencies):
- MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0, ISC, CC0 (public domain)
- Boost, Unlicense, WTFPL

**Incompatible Licenses** (Cannot use as dependencies):
- GPL, LGPL, AGPL (copyleft, would force Caro to be GPL)
- Proprietary/closed-source (no redistribution rights)

**Problematic Licenses** (Require review):
- MPL 2.0 (file-level copyleft, requires disclosure)
- EPL (Eclipse Public License, GPL-incompatible)

---

### Dependency Audit Process

**Automated** (CI):
```bash
# Check for incompatible licenses
cargo install cargo-license
cargo license --json | jq '.[] | select(.license | contains("GPL"))'

# Fail build if GPL found
if [[ $GPL_COUNT -gt 0 ]]; then
    echo "Error: GPL dependency found!"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Manual Review**:
- Review all new dependencies before adding
- Check license on crates.io
- If unclear, email legal@caro-cli.dev

---

### Attribution Requirements

**Apache 2.0 Dependencies**:
- Require NOTICE file (list Apache 2.0 dependencies)
- Include in binary distribution

**NOTICE File** (if Apache 2.0 deps present):
```
Caro includes dependencies licensed under Apache License 2.0:
- dependency-name (https://crates.io/crates/dependency-name)

See LICENSE-APACHE for full license text.
```

---

## Terms of Service

LIABILITY...
```

**Translation**: Contributors not liable if Caro causes harm (user assumes risk)
