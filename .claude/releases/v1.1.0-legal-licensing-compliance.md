## Project License

### MIT License

**Caro is licensed under the MIT License**

**License File**: `LICENSE` (project root)

**Full Text**:
```
MIT License

Copyright (c) 2026 Caro Contributors

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights

```

---

### Why MIT License?

**Permissive and Business-Friendly**:
- Allows commercial use
- Allows modification and distribution
- Minimal restrictions
- Compatible with most other licenses

**Community Growth**:
- Encourages adoption (vs. GPL)
- Allows integration into proprietary software
- No "viral" copyleft requirements

**Simplicity**:
- Short, easy to understand
- Well-established and legally tested
- Low compliance burden

---

### License Headers

**All source files should include**:

```rust
// Copyright (c) 2026 Caro Contributors
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```

**Automated Check** (CI):
```bash
# Check all .rs files have license header
find src -name "*.rs" | xargs grep -L "SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT" && echo "Missing license headers!" && exit 1
```

---

## Dependency Licensing

### Allowed Licenses

**Permissive Licenses** (✅ Allowed):
- MIT
- Apache-2.0
- BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause
- ISC
- Unlicense
- CC0-1.0 (public domain)

**Weak Copyleft** (✅ Allowed with restrictions):
- MPL-2.0 (Mozilla Public License 2.0)
  - Only if used as library (not modified)
- LGPL-2.1, LGPL-3.0 (Lesser GPL)
  - Only for dynamic linking (Rust crates are statically linked, avoid LGPL)

**Strong Copyleft** (❌ Not Allowed):
- GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0
- AGPL-3.0
- SSPL (Server Side Public License)

**Reason**: Strong copyleft licenses are incompatible with MIT and could force Caro to change license

---

### Dependency Audit

**Check all dependencies**:

```bash
# List all dependency licenses
cargo lichking list

# Check for problematic licenses
cargo lichking check
```

**Automated CI Check**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/license-check.yml
name: License Check

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - run: cargo install cargo-lichking
      - run: cargo lichking check
```

---

### Current Dependencies (v1.1.0-beta)

**Direct Dependencies** (20):

| Crate | License | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `clap` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | ✅ Allowed |
| `serde` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | ✅ Allowed |
| `tokio` | MIT | ✅ Allowed |
| `anyhow` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | ✅ Allowed |
| `candle-core` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | ✅ Allowed |
| `candle-nn` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | ✅ Allowed |
| `candle-transformers` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | ✅ Allowed |
| `hf-hub` | Apache-2.0 | ✅ Allowed |
| `regex` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | ✅ Allowed |
| `log` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | ✅ Allowed |
| `env_logger` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | ✅ Allowed |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Transitive Dependencies**: ~150 crates (all checked, all permissive)

**No problematic licenses detected** ✅

---

### License Compliance Process

**On Adding New Dependency**:

1. **Check License**:
   ```bash
   cargo tree -p <crate-name> --format "{p} {l}"
   ```

2. **Verify Allowed**: Compare against allowed list

3. **Document**: Add to dependency list in `DEPENDENCIES.md`

4. **CI Verification**: Automated check on PR

---

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

### CLA Policy: No CLA Required

**Caro does NOT require a CLA**

**Reasoning**:
- MIT license is permissive enough
- CLA creates friction for contributors
- DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) sufficient

---

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

**All commits must include DCO sign-off**:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: add new feature"
```

**DCO Text** (from Linux Foundation):
```
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

**Enforcement**: Git commit hook checks for `Signed-off-by:` line

---

## Trademark and Branding

### Caro Trademark

**Status**: Not registered (too early, expensive)

**Common Law Trademark**: "Caro" and logo used in commerce establish common law rights

**Protection**:
- Consistent use of name "Caro" (capitalized)
- Logo files in `assets/` directory
- Trademark notice: "Caro™" or "Caro is a trademark of [Project Maintainer]"

---

### Logo Usage Policy

**Allowed Uses**:
- ✅ Documentation, tutorials, blog posts about Caro
- ✅ Links to Caro project
- ✅ Unmodified logo for promotional purposes
- ✅ Fork logos (with clear indication it's a fork)

**Not Allowed**:
- ❌ Implying official endorsement (without permission)
- ❌ Commercial use (selling products with Caro logo)
- ❌ Modifying logo (changing colors, proportions)
- ❌ Confusingly similar logos (impersonation)

**Guidelines**: `docs/TRADEMARK.md` (to be created)

---

## Copyright and Attribution

### Copyright Ownership

**Contributors retain copyright** to their contributions

**Copyright Notice**:
```

**Attribution**: All contributors listed in `CONTRIBUTORS.md`

---

### Third-Party Code

**If including third-party code**:

1. **Check License**: Ensure compatible (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD)

## Privacy and Data Protection

### GDPR Compliance

**Caro collects minimal data (opt-in telemetry only)**

**GDPR Requirements**:
- ✅ User consent (explicit opt-in)
- ✅ Data minimization (only essential metrics)
- ✅ Purpose limitation (usage analytics only)
- ✅ Right to access (telemetry is local, user owns data)
- ✅ Right to erasure (user can delete local telemetry)
- ✅ Data portability (JSON format, easy export)

**Privacy Policy**: `docs/PRIVACY.md`

```markdown
# Caro Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 2026-01-08

## Data Collection

Caro collects minimal, anonymous usage data **only if you opt in**.

**What we collect (if you opt in)**:
- Command generation count (total, not individual commands)
- Backend usage (static matcher vs. LLM)
- Platform (macOS, Linux) and architecture (x86_64, ARM64)
- Version (e.g., 1.1.0-beta)
- Error rates (anonymized, no error messages)

**What we DON'T collect**:
- Your actual commands or queries
- Your files, directories, or system information
- Your IP address, location, or identity
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

**How we use this data**:
- Improve command generation quality
- Prioritize platform support
- Fix bugs faster

**Data storage**:
- Stored locally on your machine (`~/.caro/telemetry/`)
- Uploaded weekly to our server (if you opt in)
- Aggregated and anonymized before analysis

**Your rights**:
- Opt out anytime: `caro config set telemetry.enabled false`
- Delete local data: `rm -rf ~/.caro/telemetry/`
- Request data deletion: Email privacy@caro-cli.dev

## Third-Party Services

We use:
- **GitHub** (hosting, issues) - [GitHub Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)
- **Discord** (community chat) - [Discord Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy)

## Contact

Questions? Email privacy@caro-cli.dev
```

---

### CCPA Compliance (California Consumer Privacy Act)

**Caro is CCPA-compliant by design**:
- No sale of personal data (we don't collect any)
- User control over data (opt-in, opt-out, delete)
- Transparent privacy policy

---

## Security and Vulnerability Disclosure

### Responsible Disclosure Policy

**File**: `SECURITY.md` (project root)

```markdown
# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

**Instead**, email: security@caro-cli.dev

**Include**:
- Description of vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

**Response Time**: We'll respond within 48 hours.

**Disclosure Timeline**:
- We'll work with you to understand and fix the issue
- We'll release a security patch within 7 days (for critical issues)
- We'll publicly disclose after fix is released
- We'll credit you (with your permission)

## Bug Bounty

We don't have a formal bug bounty program yet (small OSS project), but we'll recognize security researchers in:
- Release notes
- SECURITY.md credits
- Swag (stickers, t-shirt) once we have them

Thank you for keeping Caro secure! 🔒
```

---

## Export Control and Sanctions

### Cryptography

**Caro does not include cryptographic functionality**

- No encryption/decryption
- No key generation
- No cryptographic algorithms

**Reasoning**: Avoids export control regulations (ITAR, EAR)

---

### Sanctions Compliance

**Caro is distributed via**:
- GitHub (US-based)
- crates.io (US-based)

**GitHub Terms**: Prohibit use in sanctioned countries (Iran, North Korea, Syria, Cuba, Crimea)

**Caro's Position**: We rely on GitHub's compliance, no additional restrictions

---

## Open Source Licensing Best Practices

### License Compatibility

**MIT is compatible with**:
- Apache-2.0 (can combine, must include Apache notices)
- BSD licenses (can combine)
- GPL (MIT code can be included in GPL project, but not vice versa)

**Incompatible**:
- GPL code cannot be included in MIT project (without relicensing)

---

### Dual Licensing (Not Applicable)

**Caro uses single license (MIT)**

**Dual licensing (MIT OR Apache-2.0)** is common in Rust ecosystem but unnecessary for Caro:
- No Apache-2.0-only dependencies
- No patent concerns (Caro doesn't implement patented algorithms)
- Simplicity preferred

---

## Compliance Checklist
