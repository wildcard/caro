1/10 🚀 Launching Caro today!

A CLI tool that generates shell commands from natural language using a local LLM.

No cloud. No API keys. Just fast, private command generation.

[GIF demo]

2/10 Why build this?

I got tired of googling "find files modified in last 7 days" for the 100th time.

Caro generates it instantly: `find . -mtime -7`

Works offline, respects your privacy.

3/10 How it works:

1️⃣ Static matcher (86% accuracy, <50ms)
2️⃣ Local LLM fallback (SmolLM 135M, <2s)
3️⃣ Safety validation (blocks dangerous commands)

[Architecture diagram]

...

10/10 Try it now:
curl -sSL caro-cli.dev/install | sh

- Twitter (free)
- Reddit (free)
- Hacker News (free)
- Dev.to (free)
- YouTube (free)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Launch Traction

**Scenario**: <100 GitHub stars in Week 1

**Mitigation**:
- Re-launch on different platforms (2 weeks later)
- Improve messaging (A/B test titles)
- Reach out to influencers (request coverage)
- Focus on niche communities (r/LocalLLaMA, r/rust)

---

### Risk 2: Negative Feedback

**Scenario**: "Doesn't work", "Accuracy sucks", "Why not just use Copilot?"

**Response**:
- Acknowledge feedback professionally
- Explain limitations honestly (beta release)
- Gather specific bug reports (GitHub issues)
- Fix critical issues within 48 hours
- Communicate fixes publicly

**Example**:
> "Thanks for the feedback! You're right that accuracy for X category is lower. We're actively working on this (see #123). Our focus on privacy and local execution is the trade-off. Appreciate you trying it out!"

---

### Risk 3: Competitor Launch

**Scenario**: GitHub Copilot CLI adds safety validation, local mode

**Response**:
- Double down on differentiators (open source, Rust, speed)
- Build community moat (engaged Discord, contributors)
- Innovate faster (monthly releases, new features)
- Emphasize philosophy (privacy-first, community-driven)

---

## Success Stories (Hypothetical Examples)

**Example 1: Developer Productivity**
> "Caro saved me 2 hours this week. I used to google 'how to find files modified today' every time. Now I just type `caro 'files modified today'` and get `find . -mtime 0`. Game changer." - @alice, Twitter

**Example 2: Learning Aid**
> "As a bootcamp student, the command line was intimidating. Caro helped me understand what each command does. Now I'm comfortable with bash!" - @bob, Discord

**Example 3: Privacy Win**
> "I love that Caro runs locally. No more sending my queries to OpenAI. Fast, private, and open source - the perfect combo." - @charlie, Hacker News
