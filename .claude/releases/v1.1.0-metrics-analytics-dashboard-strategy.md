## Overview

### What is This Strategy?

This document defines our comprehensive approach to **measuring Caro's success through privacy-preserving analytics**. It covers what we track, how we track it, how we visualize it, and how we use data to improve the product.

### Why Metrics Matter

**Problem**: Without metrics, we're flying blind. We don't know:
- Is Caro helping users or frustrating them?
- Which features are used? Which are ignored?
- Where do users get stuck?
- Is the product improving over time?

**Solution**: Privacy-first analytics that answer key questions while respecting user privacy.

### Guiding Principles

1. **Privacy First**: Never compromise user privacy for metrics
2. **Actionable Over Vanity**: Track what we can act on, not what looks good
3. **Context Over Numbers**: Understand why, not just what
4. **Aggregated, Not Individual**: Track trends, not specific users
5. **Transparent**: Users can see what we track and why

---

## Privacy-First Analytics Philosophy

### What We DON'T Track

**NEVER Collected**:
- ❌ User names or identifiers
- ❌ Email addresses
- ❌ IP addresses
- ❌ File paths or directory structures
- ❌ Environment variables
- ❌ API keys or credentials
- ❌ Command arguments containing sensitive data
- ❌ Location data

### What We DO Track (With Consent)

**Collected Only If User Opts In** (`caro config telemetry --enable`):
- ✅ Command categories (file_management, process_monitoring, etc.)
- ✅ Success/failure status (did command work?)
- ✅ Platform (macOS/Linux, version)
- ✅ App version (caro 1.1.0-beta)
- ✅ Timing (response time, installation date)
- ✅ Feature usage (which features are used?)
- ✅ Error types (what goes wrong?)

**Key Principle**: Track patterns, not individuals. Aggregate data, never individual traces.

---

### Privacy Validation

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All telemetry must pass privacy validation (ZERO PII).

**Validation Layers**:
1. **Type System**: Telemetry events are strongly typed, PII fields don't exist
2. **Regex Validation**: Automated checks for email, paths, IPs
3. **Manual Audits**: Two independent audits before each release
4. **User Export**: Users can `caro telemetry export` and inspect their data
5. **Automated Tests**: 220+ tests validate privacy guarantees

**Example Event** (what we collect):
```json
{
  "event_type": "command_generated",
  "category": "file_management",
  "success": true,
  "platform": "macos_14.2_arm64",
  "version": "1.1.0-beta",
  "response_time_ms": 124,
  "timestamp": "2026-01-24T10:15:30Z"
}
```

**What we DON'T collect**:
```json
{
  "user_email": "user@example.com",  // ❌ NEVER
  "command": "find /Users/john/Documents",  // ❌ NEVER
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",  // ❌ NEVER
  "file_path": "/Users/john/project",  // ❌ NEVER
}
```

---

## Metrics Framework

### AARRR Framework (Pirate Metrics)

We use the **AARRR framework** to organize metrics across the user journey:

1. **Acquisition**: How do users find Caro?
2. **Activation**: Do users experience value quickly?
3. **Retention**: Do users come back?
4. **Referral**: Do users recommend Caro?
5. **Revenue**: (Not applicable for open source, but track adoption)

---

### Metrics Hierarchy

**Tier 1: North Star Metric**
- **Primary**: Weekly Active Users (WAU)
- **Why**: Measures sustained value and habit formation

**Tier 2: Core Metrics** (AARRR)
- Acquisition: GitHub stars, downloads
- Activation: First command within 2 minutes
- Retention: 7-day return rate
- Referral: NPS score
- Revenue: N/A (open source)

**Tier 3: Supporting Metrics**
- Product health: Success rate, response time, error rate
- User journey: Onboarding completion, feature adoption
- Community: Discord growth, support response time

---

## User Journey Metrics

### Onboarding Funnel

**Goal**: Identify where users drop off during onboarding

**Funnel Stages**:
1. **Download**: User downloads Caro
2. **Install**: User installs successfully (`caro --version` works)
3. **First Command**: User runs first command
4. **3+ Commands**: User explores (3+ commands in Day 1)

- 3+ Commands → Return: >50%
- Return → Habit: >40%

**How to Track**: Telemetry funnel analysis

**Example Report**:
```
Onboarding Funnel - Week 1 (Jan 24-31)

Downloads:           500
↓ 96% (goal: >95%)
Installs:            480
↓ 92% (goal: >90%)

- P95: <2 seconds

**How to Track**: Telemetry: `response_time_ms` field in events

---

### Error Rate

**Definition**: % of commands that result in errors

**Formula**: (Commands with errors) / (Total commands) × 100

**Target**: <5%

**How to Track**: Telemetry: `error_occurred` event with error type

**Error Types to Track**:
- Parse error (couldn't understand query)
- Timeout (took too long)
- Invalid command (generated command is malformed)
- Platform mismatch (wrong platform syntax)

---

### Platform Breakdown

**Goal**: Understand platform usage and identify platform-specific issues

**Platforms**:

## Data Collection Implementation

### Telemetry Events

**Event Types**:

#### 1. Installation Event
```rust
InstallationSuccess {
    platform: String,      // "macos_14.2_arm64"
    version: String,       // "1.1.0-beta"
    install_method: String,  // "homebrew" | "script" | "manual"
    timestamp: DateTime,
}
```

#### 2. Command Generated Event
```rust
CommandGenerated {
    category: String,      // "file_management"
    success: bool,         // true | false
    platform: String,
    version: String,
    response_time_ms: u64,
    timestamp: DateTime,
}
```

#### 3. Error Event
```rust
ErrorOccurred {
    error_type: String,    // "parse_error" | "timeout" | etc.
    category: Option<String>,
    platform: String,
    version: String,
    timestamp: DateTime,
}
```

#### 4. Feature Used Event
```rust
FeatureUsed {
    feature: String,       // "help" | "tutorial" | "config"
    platform: String,
    version: String,
    timestamp: DateTime,
}
```

---

### Telemetry Storage

**Local Storage**: `~/.caro/telemetry.db` (SQLite)
- Stores events locally on user's machine
- User can inspect: `caro telemetry export telemetry.json`
- User controls deletion: `caro telemetry clear`

**Opt-In Upload** (future feature, v1.2.0+):
- User can opt in to upload anonymized data
- Upload endpoint: `https://telemetry.caro-cli.dev/v1/events`
- Aggregated on server (no individual tracking)

---

### Privacy Safeguards in Code

**Implementation**:

```rust
// Privacy validation before storing event
impl TelemetryEvent {
    fn validate_privacy(&self) -> Result<(), PrivacyError> {
        // Check for PII patterns
        let pii_patterns = [
            r"[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}",  // Email
            r"/Users/[^/]+",  // macOS paths with usernames
            r"/home/[^/]+",   // Linux paths with usernames
            r"\b\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\b",  // IP addresses
        ];

        for pattern in pii_patterns {
            let re = Regex::new(pattern)?;
            if re.is_match(&self.to_string()) {
                return Err(PrivacyError::PiiDetected);
            }
        }

        Ok(())
    }
}

// Only store event if privacy validation passes
pub fn record_event(event: TelemetryEvent) -> Result<()> {
    event.validate_privacy()?;  // BLOCK if PII detected
    database.insert(event)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Data-Driven Decision Making

### Decision Framework

**Process**:
1. **Observe**: What does the data show?
2. **Hypothesize**: Why is this happening?
3. **Decide**: What should we do?
4. **Act**: Implement change
5. **Measure**: Did it work?

---

### Example: Low First Command Rate

**Observe** (Week 1 data):
- First command within 2 min: 65% (target: >80%)
- 35% of users install but never run a command

**Hypothesize**:
- Users don't know what to try first
- Post-install message not clear enough
- Installation doesn't suggest a command

**Decide**:
- Improve post-install message
- Add suggested first command to README
- Create `caro examples` command

**Act** (Week 2):
- Update Homebrew post-install message
- Update install script message
- Add `caro examples` command in v1.1.1

**Measure** (Week 3):
- First command within 2 min: 82% (↑17 percentage points!)
- Goal achieved ✅

---

### Example: High Error Rate in Text Processing

**Observe** (Month 1 data):
- Error rate: 12% in text_processing (goal: <5%)
- All other categories <5%

**Hypothesize**:
- Text processing queries are more complex
- Users expect regex, but Caro doesn't support it well
- Platform differences (GNU vs BSD grep)

**Decide**:
- Add regex examples to help
- Improve prompt engineering for text processing
- Add platform-specific regex handling

**Act** (Month 2):
- Update prompts with regex examples
- Add regex pattern validation
- Document regex limitations in Known Issues

**Measure** (Month 3):
- Error rate: 6% in text_processing (↓6 percentage points)
- Still above goal, continue iterating
