## Quick Reference: Pass/Fail Criteria

### Always BLOCKING (Never Waive)
- ❌ PII found in telemetry → EMERGENCY STOP
- ❌ P0 bugs → BLOCK until fixed
- ❌ Critical security vulnerabilities → BLOCK until fixed
- ❌ Privacy audit failed → BLOCK until fixed
- ❌ Installation completely broken → BLOCK until fixed

### Usually BLOCKING (Rarely Waive)
- ⚠️ Success rate <70% → Usually BLOCK, fix patterns
- ⚠️ All beta testers couldn't install → BLOCK, fix install
- ⚠️ Telemetry crashes application → BLOCK, fix stability

### Can Waive with Justification
- ✅ Success rate 70-80% (target 80%) → Document, release with caveats
- ✅ NPS 0-30 (target 30+) → Acceptable if issues tracked
- ✅ Satisfaction 3.5-4.0 (target 4.0+) → Acceptable if no critical issues
- ✅ Performance P95 2-5s (target <2s) → Acceptable if static matcher fast

### Nice to Have (Non-Blocking)
- ℹ️ Static matcher >85% → Already achieved
- ℹ️ Test coverage >80% → Quality indicator only
- ℹ️ Community interest signals → Market validation only

## Emergency Stop Triggers

**Immediate STOP and incident response if**:
1. PII discovered in telemetry (any stage)
2. P0 bug causing data loss or crashes
3. Critical security vulnerability exploited
4. Privacy policy violation reported
5. Telemetry system causing widespread failures

**Action**: Follow incident response plan immediately

---

## Checklist Usage Guidelines

### How to Use These Checklists

1. **Before Each Milestone**: Review relevant checklist
2. **During Validation**: Check off items as verified
3. **At Gate Review**: Ensure all items checked or waived
4. **Document Waivers**: If skipping HIGH items, document why
5. **Sign-Off**: Get required approvals before proceeding

### Checklist Discipline

- **Never skip CRITICAL items** - these are non-negotiable
- **Rarely skip HIGH items** - require strong justification
- **MEDIUM items optional** - nice to have, not blocking
- **Document everything** - decisions, waivers, reasoning

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Checking boxes without actual verification
- ❌ Proceeding with failed CRITICAL items
- ❌ Waiving multiple HIGH items without discussion
- ❌ Skipping sign-off requirements
- ❌ Ignoring emergency stop triggers
