## Open Source Vision

### Mission
**"Build a thriving, collaborative open-source community where every contribution—big or small—makes Caro better for everyone."**

### Open Source Values
1. **Inclusive**: Everyone can contribute, regardless of experience
2. **Transparent**: Decisions made openly, roadmap public
3. **Meritocratic**: Good ideas win, regardless of who proposes them
4. **Sustainable**: Maintainers supported, not burned out
5. **Community-First**: Community needs > individual agendas

### Why Open Source?
- **Trust**: Code is auditable (privacy, security claims verifiable)
- **Quality**: More eyes find more bugs
- **Innovation**: Community contributes features maintainers wouldn't build
- **Longevity**: Project survives beyond original creators
- **Learning**: Contributors learn Rust, CLI development, open source

---

## Governance Model

### Structure: Benevolent Dictator Lite (BDL)

**Inspired By**: Linux, Python, Rust (BDFL with community input)

**Why This Model**:
- Clear decision-making (no deadlock)
- Community input valued (not ignored)
- Scales well (from 1 to 100+ contributors)
- Flexible (can evolve as project grows)

---

### Roles

**1. Project Lead** (1 person)
- **Current**: [Founder Name]
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Final say on major decisions (architecture, roadmap, governance changes)
  - Resolve deadlocks (when community can't agree)
  - Set project vision and direction
  - Approve new maintainers
- **Term**: Indefinite (unless steps down or community votes to replace)

**2. Core Maintainers** (3-5 people)
- **Current**: [Founder + 2-4 trusted contributors]
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Code review and merge
  - Issue triage and labeling
  - Release management
  - Community moderation
  - Mentor contributors
- **Term**: Indefinite (invited by Project Lead, can step down anytime)
- **Selection**: Promoted from active contributors based on merit

**3. Contributors** (anyone)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Submit PRs (code, docs, tests)
  - Report issues
  - Review others' PRs
  - Help in discussions
- **Recognition**: Listed in CONTRIBUTORS.md, credited in release notes

**4. Community Members** (everyone)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Use Caro
  - Provide feedback
  - Participate in discussions
  - Welcome newcomers

---

### Maintainer Selection

**Criteria** (must meet ALL):
1. **Active**: 3+ months of consistent contributions
2. **Quality**: High-quality PRs (clean code, good tests, clear docs)
3. **Collaborative**: Helpful in reviews, respectful in discussions
4. **Aligned**: Understands and supports project vision
5. **Available**: Commits to 5+ hours/week for maintainer duties

**Process**:
1. Project Lead identifies candidate (or candidate self-nominates)
2. Existing maintainers vote (simple majority, 1 week voting period)
3. If approved, invite sent
4. 1-month trial period (shadow existing maintainer)
5. Full maintainer status granted (or extended trial if needed)

**Removal** (rare, serious cases only):
- Inactivity (>6 months without communication)
- Code of Conduct violations (after warning)
- Community vote (2/3 majority of maintainers + Project Lead approval)

---

## Decision-Making Process

### Decision Types

**Type 1: Trivial** (No approval needed)
- Documentation fixes (typos, clarity)
- Minor bug fixes (clear, low-risk)
- Dependency updates (patch versions)
- **Process**: Submit PR, self-merge if maintainer (or any maintainer merges)

**Type 2: Standard** (Maintainer approval)
- Feature implementations (from roadmap)
- Refactoring (improves code quality)
- New tests
- **Process**: Submit PR, 1 maintainer approval required

**Type 3: Significant** (2 maintainer approvals)
- New features (not on roadmap)
- Breaking API changes
- Major refactors (architectural changes)
- Dependency updates (major versions)
- **Process**: Submit PR, 2 maintainer approvals required

**Type 4: Major** (Community consensus + Project Lead approval)
- Governance changes (this document)
- License changes
- Project rename or rebrand
- **Process**: RFC (Request for Comments) → Community discussion (2 weeks) → Vote → Project Lead final approval

---

### RFC Process (Request for Comments)

**When to Use**:
- Major features (significant scope or complexity)
- Breaking changes (affect existing users)
- Architectural decisions (long-term impact)

**RFC Template**:
```markdown
# RFC: [Title]

## Summary
[One-paragraph summary of the proposal]

## Motivation
[Why are we doing this? What problem does it solve?]

## Detailed Design
[Technical details: API, architecture, implementation]

## Drawbacks
[Why should we NOT do this? Trade-offs?]

## Alternatives
[What other approaches were considered? Why not those?]

## Unresolved Questions
[What questions need to be answered before implementation?]

## Implementation Plan
[Rough timeline, who will do it, dependencies]
```

**RFC Process**:
1. **Draft**: Create RFC.md in `rfcs/` directory, submit PR
2. **Discussion**: 2-week comment period (GitHub, Discord)
3. **Revision**: Revise based on feedback
4. **Vote**: Maintainers vote (simple majority)
5. **Decision**: Project Lead approves or rejects (with explanation)
6. **Implementation**: If approved, create tracking issue, implement

---

### Consensus vs Authority

**Preference**: Consensus
- Most decisions should emerge from community discussion
- Maintainers guide discussion, but don't dictate outcomes

**When Authority Used**:
- Deadlock (community can't agree after reasonable discussion)
- Time-sensitive decisions (security patches)
- Vision alignment (proposal conflicts with core values)

**Authority Exercise** (Project Lead):
- Explain reasoning (transparency)
- Consider dissenting views (but final decision is binding)
- Document decision (for future reference)

---

## Contribution Workflow

### Getting Started (First Contribution)

**Step 1: Find an Issue**
- Browse issues: https://github.com/[org]/caro/issues
- Look for labels:
  - `good first issue`: Easy, well-defined, mentor available
  - `help wanted`: Medium difficulty, community contribution welcome
  - `documentation`: Non-code contributions

**Step 2: Claim the Issue**
- Comment: "I'd like to work on this!"
- Maintainer assigns issue to you (prevents duplicate work)
- Ask questions if anything is unclear

**Step 3: Fork & Branch**
```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/caro.git
cd caro

# Create branch
git checkout -b fix-issue-123
```

**Step 4: Make Changes**
- Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) (coding standards)
- Write tests (unit tests for logic, integration for workflows)
- Update docs (README, docstrings, examples)

**Step 5: Commit**
```bash
# Commit with conventional commit format
git add .
git commit -m "fix(safety): block dangerous rm command

- Add safety pattern for rm -rf with wildcards
- Add tests for edge cases
- Update KNOWN_ISSUES.md

Fixes #123"
```

**Step 6: Push & PR**
```bash
git push origin fix-issue-123

# Open PR on GitHub
# Use PR template (automatically populated)
```

**Step 7: Code Review**
- Maintainer reviews (usually within 48 hours)
- Address feedback (respond to comments, push updates)
- Iterate until approved

**Step 8: Merge**
- Maintainer merges PR
- You're credited in release notes
- Issue auto-closed

---

### Contribution Guidelines

**Code Quality**:
- Passes CI (tests, clippy, rustfmt)
- Test coverage: >80% for new code
- No `unsafe` code (unless absolutely necessary, with justification)
- Clear, self-documenting code (avoid clever tricks)

**Commit Messages**:
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`
- Example: `feat(telemetry): add command category tracking`

**Documentation**:
- Public functions have docstrings
- Complex logic has inline comments (why, not what)
- User-facing changes update README, docs/

**Testing**:
- Unit tests for logic
- Integration tests for workflows
- Manual testing for UX changes

---

## Code Review Process

### Review Timeline

| PR Type | Target Review Time | Target Merge Time |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Trivial** (docs, typos) | <24 hours | <48 hours |
| **Standard** (features, fixes) | <48 hours | <1 week |
| **Significant** (major changes) | <1 week | <2 weeks |

---

### Reviewer Responsibilities

**What Reviewers Check**:
1. **Correctness**: Does it solve the problem?
2. **Quality**: Is the code clean, maintainable?
3. **Tests**: Are there tests? Do they pass?
4. **Documentation**: Is it documented?
5. **Style**: Does it follow project conventions?
6. **Architecture**: Does it fit the design?

**Review Tone**:
- **Constructive**: "Consider using X instead" (not "This is wrong")
- **Educational**: Explain why (not just what to change)
- **Respectful**: Thank contributor, acknowledge effort
- **Specific**: Point to exact lines, suggest concrete fixes

**Example Review Comments**:
```
✅ Good:
"Nice work! One suggestion: Consider using `str::trim()` here instead of manual
whitespace removal. It's more idiomatic and handles edge cases like tabs.

Example:
let trimmed = input.trim();

What do you think?"

❌ Bad:
"This is wrong. Fix it."
```

---

### Contributor Responsibilities

**Responding to Feedback**:
- Be receptive (feedback is to help, not criticize)
- Ask questions (if feedback is unclear)
- Push updates (fix issues, don't just acknowledge)
- Discuss trade-offs (if you disagree, explain why respectfully)

**After Approval**:
- Squash commits (if requested by reviewer)
- Wait for maintainer to merge (don't self-merge unless you're a maintainer)
