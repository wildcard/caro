## Overview

### What is This Strategy?

This document outlines our approach to **strategic partnerships and integrations** that expand Caro's reach, enhance its capabilities, and build a stronger ecosystem. It covers potential partners, integration opportunities, and the process for establishing partnerships.

### Why Partnerships Matter

**Problem**: As a new open-source project, Caro faces:
- Limited brand awareness
- Small user base
- Lack of integration with existing workflows
- Need for distribution channels

**Solution**: Strategic partnerships that provide:
- **Distribution**: Access to existing user bases
- **Credibility**: Association with trusted brands
- **Integration**: Seamless workflows with popular tools
- **Community**: Access to engaged communities

### Guiding Principles

1. **Open Source First**: Prioritize partnerships that align with open-source values
2. **User Value**: Only pursue partnerships that genuinely help users
3. **Privacy Respecting**: Never compromise privacy for partnership
4. **Win-Win**: Seek mutually beneficial relationships
5. **Community-Driven**: Prioritize community needs over commercial interests

---
