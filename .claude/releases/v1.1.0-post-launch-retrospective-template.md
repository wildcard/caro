## Conclusion

### Overall Assessment

**Launch Grade**: ☐ A+ ☐ A ☐ B ☐ C ☐ D

**Summary**:
```
[3-5 sentences summarizing the launch]

Example:
The v1.1.0-beta launch was a solid B+. We achieved our technical goals (86.2% pass rate) and exceeded GitHub star targets (1,200 vs 1,000 goal). However, we faced unexpected installation issues on macOS that affected ~30% of early adopters. The community response was overwhelmingly positive, with excellent engagement on HN and Reddit. Key learning: invest more in fresh-install testing across platforms.
