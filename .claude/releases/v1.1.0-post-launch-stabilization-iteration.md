| PII leak in telemetry | **ROLLBACK** + disable telemetry immediately |
| Dangerous command executed | **ROLLBACK** + hotfix safety validation |
| Data corruption | **ROLLBACK** immediately |
| Unable to fix P0 within 4 hours | **ROLLBACK**, fix offline, re-release |
| Multiple P1 bugs in first hour | **CONSIDER ROLLBACK**, assess impact |
| Single P0 with clear fix | **HOTFIX**, don't rollback |

**Rollback Process**: See `.claude/releases/v1.1.0-release-runbook-sop.md` Section 4.

## Section 7: Performance Optimization

### Performance Monitoring

**Key Metrics** (Tracked continuously):
- **Latency**: p50, p95, p99 response times by query type
- **Throughput**: Commands generated per second
- **Memory**: Resident memory usage, peak memory
- **Model Loading**: Time to load models on cold start
- **Binary Size**: Release binary size

**Performance Targets**:

| Metric | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 4 | v1.2.0 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Simple query (p95) | 100ms | 90ms | 80ms | 70ms |
| Medium query (p95) | 500ms | 450ms | 400ms | 350ms |
| Complex query (p95) | 1000ms | 900ms | 800ms | 700ms |
| Model loading | 5s | 4s | 3s | 2s |
| Memory usage | 50MB | 45MB | 40MB | 35MB |
| Binary size | 15MB | 14MB | 13MB | 12MB |

---

### Performance Optimization Workflow

**Weekly Performance Review**:

```bash
# 1. Run performance benchmarks
cargo bench

# 2. Compare to baseline
cargo bench --baseline week1

# 3. Profile hot paths
cargo flamegraph --bench command_generation

# 4. Identify bottlenecks
# - Model inference time
# - JSON parsing
# - String allocations
# - Disk I/O

# 5. Implement optimizations
# Week 1: Low-hanging fruit (caching, lazy loading)
# Week 2-4: Algorithmic improvements, better data structures
# v1.2.0: Architecture changes (parallel processing, streaming)

# 6. Measure improvement
cargo bench

# 7. Release optimization
# If improvement ≥20%, release as patch
# If improvement ≥50%, announce as major win
```

**Optimization Ideas from Roadmap**:
1. **Static Matcher Expansion**: Add 50+ patterns (reduces LLM fallback)
2. **LLM Quantization**: Use Q8 instead of F16 (2x faster, 50% memory)
3. **Query Caching**: Cache frequent queries (instant response)
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load models only when needed (faster startup)
5. **Parallel Processing**: Process multiple queries concurrently

---

### User-Facing Performance Improvements

**Communicate Performance Wins**:

Example announcement (Discord, Twitter):
```
🚀 Caro v1.1.3-beta Performance Update

We've been listening to your feedback on response times. Here's what we've improved:

⚡ 40% faster for common queries (list files, show processes)
⚡ 30% less memory usage (now ~35MB)
⚡ 50% faster cold start (model loads in 2.5s)

Try it: curl -fsSL https://get.caro.sh | sh

Details: [link to blog post explaining optimizations]
```

Day 1: Add to FAQ: "caro config backend --set <name>"
Day 2: Update README Configuration section
Day 3: Create video tutorial
Day 4: User successfully changes backend
```

**Documentation Metrics**:

## Section 11: Escalation & Decision-Making

### Escalation Paths

**Technical Decisions**:
1. Engineer identifies issue/decision
2. Discuss with Engineering Lead
3. If consensus, proceed
4. If disagreement, escalate to Release Manager
5. If still unclear, escalate to full team (vote if needed)

**Release Decisions** (Go/No-Go, Rollback):
1. Release Manager assesses situation
2. Consult Engineering Lead and Security Lead (if relevant)
3. Make decision (erring on side of user safety)
4. Communicate decision clearly
5. Document reasoning

**Feature Prioritization**:
1. Community Lead gathers feedback
2. Engineering Lead assesses feasibility
3. Release Manager prioritizes based on impact/effort
4. Share with community for validation
5. Implement based on priority

---

### Decision-Making Framework

**Principles**:
1. **User Safety First**: Always prioritize user safety and security
2. **Transparency**: Share reasoning for decisions publicly
3. **Data-Driven**: Use metrics and feedback to guide decisions
4. **Move Fast, Stay Safe**: Bias toward action, but not recklessness
5. **Community Input**: Involve community in important decisions

**Decision Matrix**:

| Decision Type | Authority | Consultation | Timeline |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| P0 Hotfix | Eng Lead | Release Mgr | Immediate |
| P1 Hotfix | Eng Lead | Release Mgr | 1-4 hours |
| Feature Priority | Release Mgr | Full team | 1-2 days |
| Rollback | Release Mgr | Eng Lead, Sec Lead | Immediate |
| Roadmap | Full team | Community | 1 week |
| Architecture | Eng Lead | Full team | 2 weeks |

## Section 12: Handoff & Knowledge Transfer

### Post-Stabilization Handoff

**Transition from Release Mode to Steady State** (T+30):

**Knowledge Transfer**:
- Runbook updates based on lessons learned
- Documentation of quirks and gotchas
- Handoff of monitoring responsibilities
- Training for new team members (if applicable)

**Handoff Checklist**:
- [ ] All critical incidents documented (post-mortems)

- **Strategy**: Release Manager (roadmap, priorities)

**Sustainable Cadence**:
- Weekly team sync (1 hour)
- Biweekly releases (bug fixes + small features)
- Monthly feature releases (medium/large features)
- Quarterly retrospectives (strategic review)
