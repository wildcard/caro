## Issue Triage System

### Priority Definitions

#### P0: Critical (Immediate Response)
**Definition**: Complete product failure or data loss

**Examples**:
- Caro crashes on startup for all users
- Commands execute with wrong flags (security risk)
- Privacy violation: PII leaks in telemetry
- Data corruption or loss

**Response Time**: < 4 hours acknowledgment, < 24 hours fix
**Who Handles**: Lead Developer + Release Manager immediately
**Communication**: Public acknowledgment within 1 hour

---

#### P1: High (Urgent Response)
**Definition**: Major feature broken, impacts many users

**Examples**:
- Static matcher returns no results for common queries
- LLM backend fails to connect
- Telemetry system completely broken
- Installation fails on major platform (macOS/Linux)

**Response Time**: < 24 hours acknowledgment, < 3 days fix
**Who Handles**: Lead Developer or Support Engineer
**Communication**: Public acknowledgment within 4 hours

---

#### P2: Medium (Standard Response)
**Definition**: Feature works but with limitations or minor bugs

**Examples**:
- Static matcher misses some edge cases (but 80%+ working)
- LLM responses occasionally suboptimal
- Telemetry opt-out doesn't clear existing data immediately
- Error messages unclear or unhelpful

**Response Time**: < 48 hours acknowledgment, < 1 week fix
**Who Handles**: Support Engineer
**Communication**: Acknowledged in issue tracker

---

#### P3: Low (Backlog)
**Definition**: Nice-to-have improvements, cosmetic issues

**Examples**:
- Feature requests for future versions
- Documentation improvements
- UI/output formatting tweaks
- Performance optimizations (when already acceptable)

**Response Time**: < 1 week acknowledgment, scheduled for future release
**Who Handles**: Support Engineer documents, team discusses in weekly review
**Communication**: "Thank you, we'll consider for future release"

---

### Triage Process

**Step 1: Initial Assessment** (within 1 hour of issue report)
1. **Validate**: Can we reproduce the issue?
2. **Classify**: Which priority (P0/P1/P2/P3)?
3. **Assign**: Who should handle it?
4. **Acknowledge**: Post initial response to user

**Step 2: Investigation** (within priority response time)
1. **Reproduce**: Create minimal reproduction case
2. **Root Cause**: Identify the underlying problem
3. **Scope**: How many users are affected?
4. **Workaround**: Is there a temporary solution?

**Step 3: Resolution Planning** (within priority response time)
1. **Fix Approach**: Code change, config update, or documentation?
2. **Testing**: What tests are needed to verify fix?
3. **Timeline**: When can fix be deployed?
4. **Communication**: How to inform affected users?

**Step 4: Verification** (after fix deployed)
1. **Confirm**: Original reporter confirms issue resolved
2. **Monitor**: Watch for related issues
3. **Document**: Update known issues list
4. **Close**: Mark issue as resolved

## Bug Fix Workflow

### Standard Bug Fix Process (P2/P3)

**Step 1: Reproduce** (Developer)
1. Clone issue locally
2. Create minimal reproduction case
3. Add reproduction test to test suite
4. Comment on issue: "Confirmed, working on fix"

**Step 2: Implement Fix** (Developer)
1. Create fix branch: `fix/issue-XXX-short-description`
2. Write failing test demonstrating bug
3. Implement fix
4. Verify test now passes
5. Run full test suite: `cargo test`
6. Run Clippy: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`

**Step 3: Code Review** (Peer Reviewer)
1. Review fix logic
2. Review test coverage
3. Check for unintended side effects
4. Approve or request changes

**Step 4: Merge & Deploy** (Release Manager)
1. Merge fix to main
2. Run CI/CD checks
3. Tag new version: `v1.1.X` (patch increment)
4. Build and publish binaries
5. Update GitHub release notes

**Step 5: Verification** (Support Engineer)
1. Comment on issue: "Fixed in v1.1.X"
2. Ask original reporter to verify
3. Close issue after confirmation
4. Update known-issues.md

**Timeline**: P2: < 1 week, P3: Scheduled for next release

---

### Expedited Bug Fix Process (P1)

**Same as Standard, but:**
- **Timeline**: < 3 days from report to deployment
- **Review**: Can be same developer (peer review optional)
- **Testing**: Must include regression tests
- **Communication**: Public update every 24 hours

**Example Timeline**:
- Day 1: Reproduce and implement fix
- Day 2: Test and merge
- Day 3: Deploy and verify

---

### Emergency Hotfix Process (P0)

**Step 1: Immediate Assessment** (< 1 hour)
1. **Validate**: Is this truly P0? (Complete failure or data loss?)
2. **Scope**: How many users affected?
3. **Workaround**: Is there a temporary mitigation?
4. **Communicate**: Post public acknowledgment immediately

**Step 2: Emergency Response** (< 4 hours)
1. **Assemble Team**: Release Manager + Lead Developer + QA
2. **Diagnose**: Identify root cause
3. **Decide**:
   - Fix forward: Deploy patch
   - Roll back: Revert to previous version
   - Disable: Turn off broken feature

**Step 3: Hotfix Implementation** (< 12 hours)
1. Create hotfix branch: `hotfix/v1.1.X-critical-issue`
2. Minimal fix (no refactoring, no extras)
3. Test only the critical path
4. Peer review (if possible, skip if not)
5. Merge to main
6. Tag: `v1.1.X-hotfix`

**Step 4: Emergency Deployment** (< 24 hours)
1. Build binaries (all platforms)
2. Publish to GitHub releases
3. Update installation scripts
4. Force-push to Homebrew/package managers
5. Post public announcement: "Critical fix released"

**Step 5: Post-Mortem** (within 48 hours)
1. Document what happened
2. Document why it happened
3. Document how we fixed it
4. Document how we prevent it in future
5. Share publicly (transparency builds trust)

**Communication Template**:
```
🚨 CRITICAL FIX RELEASED: v1.1.X-hotfix

**Issue**: [Brief description]
**Impact**: [Who was affected]
**Fix**: [What we changed]
**Action**: Please update immediately: `caro update` or reinstall

## Escalation Procedures

### When to Escalate?

**Immediate Escalation** (within 30 minutes):
- P0 bug discovered
- Privacy violation detected
- Security vulnerability found
- Multiple users reporting same critical issue
- Service completely down

**Standard Escalation** (within 24 hours):
- P1 bug cannot be resolved by primary owner
- User extremely unhappy (threatening to abandon product)
- Media inquiry about issue
- Legal concern raised by user
- Pattern of similar issues suggesting systemic problem

---

### Escalation Paths

#### P0 Emergency Escalation

**Step 1**: Support Engineer → Release Manager
- Method: Slack DM + @mention in #incidents channel
- Response time: < 15 minutes
- Information: Issue link, user impact, reproduction steps

**Step 2**: Release Manager → Lead Developer
- Method: Phone call + Slack (if no response in 15 min)
- Response time: < 30 minutes
- Information: Full context, severity justification

**Step 3**: Lead Developer → Engineering Leadership
- Method: Phone call (if P0 scope is massive)
- Response time: < 1 hour
- Information: User impact, business impact, resource needs

---

#### Standard Escalation

**Step 1**: Primary Owner → Release Manager
- Method: Slack DM with issue link
- Response time: < 4 hours
- Reason: "I need help with [specific blocker]"

**Step 2**: Release Manager Decision:
- Assign to different team member?
- Escalate to engineering leadership?
- Defer to next sprint?
- Need external help (e.g., third-party API support)?

---

#### User Escalation Request

**User asks to "speak to a manager"**:

1. **Acknowledge**: "I understand this is frustrating. Let me escalate this."
2. **Document**: Summarize issue and user's concern clearly
3. **Escalate**: Tag Release Manager in issue with context
4. **Follow-up**: Release Manager responds within 4 hours
5. **Resolution**: Ensure user feels heard and receives clear answer

**Never**: Dismiss user concern or say "that's not possible to escalate"
