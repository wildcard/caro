## Overview

### What is This Checklist?

This is the comprehensive pre-launch validation checklist to be completed **24-48 hours before public release** (January 22-23, 2026). It ensures all systems—technical, communication, infrastructure, support—are GO for launch.

- **Review**: January 24, 2026 at 8:00 AM (final check before launch)

### Success Criteria
