TOTAL,,,146.00,
```

### Weekly Budget Review

Every Monday during release:
- Time spent vs. estimated
- Variance analysis
- Resource reallocation if needed

---

## Open Source Economics

### Current Model (v1.1.0)
- Funding: None (self-funded)
- Labor: 100% volunteer
- Infrastructure: $12 domain
- Sustainability: Passion project

### Future Models (v1.2.0+)

1. **Donations**: GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective ($500/mo target)
2. **Sponsorships**: Companies using caro ($2k-5k/year)
3. **Grants**: OSS foundations ($10k-50k for full-time work)
4. **Paid Tiers**: Cloud API, enterprise support (CLI always free)

### Community ROI

If caro saves 10,000 devs 10 min/day = 100,000 min/day saved = 1,667 hours/day

Break-even: 5 days if saves 10 min/day per user
