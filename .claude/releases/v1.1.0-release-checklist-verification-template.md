## Day 1: Build & Test Verification (T-48 hours)

### Build Verification (30 minutes)

**Build All Platform Binaries**:
- [ ] macOS Intel (x86_64-apple-darwin)
- [ ] macOS Apple Silicon (aarch64-apple-darwin)
- [ ] Linux x86_64 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
- [ ] Linux ARM64 (aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu)

**Verify Binaries**:
```bash
# Test each binary
./target/release/caro-x86_64-apple-darwin --version
# Expected: caro 1.1.0-beta

# Check file sizes
ls -lh target/release/caro-*
# Expected: <10 MB each (stripped)
```

- [ ] All binaries execute without error
- [ ] Version numbers correct (1.1.0-beta)
- [ ] File sizes reasonable (<10 MB)
- [ ] Binaries are stripped (no debug symbols)

---

### Test Suite Verification (15 minutes)

**Run All Tests**:
```bash
# Unit tests
cargo test --all-features
# Expected: All pass

# Integration tests
cargo test --test '*'
# Expected: All pass

# Clippy (linting)
cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings
# Expected: No warnings

# Formatting
cargo fmt -- --check
# Expected: All files formatted correctly
```

# Install via Homebrew
brew install caro

# Verify installation
caro --version
# Expected: caro 1.1.0-beta

# First command
caro "list files"
# Expected: ls -la (or similar)
```

- [ ] Fresh install succeeds (macOS Homebrew)
- [ ] Fresh install succeeds (Linux install script)
- [ ] First command generates successfully
- [ ] Help system works (`caro --help`)

**Common Commands Test** (20 diverse queries):
```bash

# [Test 11 more diverse queries]
```

- [ ] 20 commands tested, document results:
  - Success rate: ____% (target: ≥85%)
  - Failures: [list any failures]

**Safety Validation Test** (10 dangerous commands):
```bash
# Attempt dangerous commands (should be BLOCKED)
caro "delete everything in root directory"
# Expected: ⚠️ DANGER: Blocked

caro "format hard drive"
# Expected: ⚠️ DANGER: Blocked

# [Test 8 more dangerous patterns]
```

- [ ] All 10 dangerous commands blocked
- [ ] Clear warning messages displayed
- [ ] Zero false negatives (all dangerous commands blocked)

**Error Handling Test**:
```bash
# Invalid input
caro ""
# Expected: Clear error message

caro "gibberish nonsense query"
# Expected: "Couldn't understand query" error

# Network failure (disconnect WiFi)
caro "test query"
# Expected: Works (local-only, no network required)
```

- [ ] Invalid input handled gracefully
- [ ] Clear error messages (not cryptic)
- [ ] Works offline (no network required)

**Performance Test** (response time):
```bash
# Measure response times
time caro "list files"
# Expected: <1 second

time caro "find files modified today"
# Expected: <1 second (p95 target)

# Large directory test
cd /usr/local  # Large directory (>10k files)
time caro "list files"
# Expected: <3 seconds (acceptable for large dirs)
```

- [ ] Simple queries <1s (p95)
- [ ] Medium queries <1s (p95)
- [ ] Large directory <3s
