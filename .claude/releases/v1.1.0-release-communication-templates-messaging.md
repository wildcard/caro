Why caro?

❌ Before: Google "how to find files by size" → copy/paste → adapt → hope it works
✅ After: caro "show files larger than 100MB" → review → execute

Built in Rust. MIT licensed. Privacy-first.

Tweet 3/5:
Safety is our #1 priority:

🔒 Validates every command
🚫 Blocks rm -rf, dd, fork bombs
✋ You approve before execution

You're always in control.

**Hacker News Version:**
```markdown
Show HN: caro – Natural language to shell commands with safety validation

Hi HN,

I'm excited to share caro v1.1.0-beta, a command-line tool that translates natural language into shell commands.

## What problem does it solve?

We've all been there: you know what you want to do, but not the exact syntax. You Google "find files modified today", copy a command, adapt it, and hope it works. caro eliminates this friction:

```bash
$ caro "show files modified in the last 24 hours"
→ Generated: find . -type f -mtime -1
[Approve? y/n]
```

## How it works:

1. **Static Matcher**: Pattern matching for common queries (fast, deterministic)
2. **Embedded Backend**: Local ML model (privacy-preserving, no internet)
3. **Ollama Backend**: More powerful models for complex queries (optional)

## Safety First:

Every command is validated before execution:
- Blocks dangerous operations (rm -rf /, dd, fork bombs)
- Checks for sudo/privilege escalation
- Flags destructive operations (chmod 777, etc.)
- YOU approve before execution

## Why Rust?

- Performance: Static matcher <100ms, embedded backend <500ms
- Safety: Memory-safe, no GC pauses
- Portability: Single binary, no runtime dependencies
- Cross-platform: macOS (Intel + ARM), Linux (x86_64 + ARM64)

## Beta Status:

This is our first public beta. Known limitations:
- Command coverage: ~75% of test cases (expanding daily)
- Platform quirks: BSD vs. GNU differences
- LLM hallucinations: Embedded models sometimes miss edge cases

## Tech Stack:

- Rust (tokio, clap, serde)
- SmolLM 135M / Qwen2.5 1.5B (embedded inference)
- Ollama integration (optional)
- 500+ unit tests, 150+ integration tests

## Open Source:

- MIT licensed
- GitHub: [link]
- Contributing: [link]

## Roadmap:

- v1.2.0: Improved platform detection, chain-of-thought prompting
- v1.3.0: Command history learning, multi-step refinement
- v2.0.0: Interactive mode, context-aware suggestions

I'd love feedback from the HN community:
- What queries would you use caro for?
- What are your biggest command-line pain points?
- Any concerns about safety, privacy, or design choices?

Looking forward to the discussion!

**Reddit r/rust, r/commandline Version:**
```markdown
**caro v1.1.0-beta: Natural language to shell commands (Rust, MIT, cross-platform)**

I've been working on caro, a CLI tool that translates natural language into shell commands with safety validation. Today I'm releasing v1.1.0-beta!

## Demo:

```bash
$ caro "show me files modified in the last hour"
→ Generated: find . -type f -mmin -60
[Approve? y/n]

$ caro "what's using port 8080?"
→ Generated: lsof -i :8080
[Approve? y/n]
```

## Why I built this:

I got tired of:
- Googling "find files by size syntax" for the 100th time
- Remembering whether it's `-mtime -1` or `-mtime 1`
- Dealing with BSD vs. GNU flag differences
- Copy-pasting commands I didn't fully understand

caro solves this by letting you describe what you want, not how to do it.

## Technical highlights:

- **Rust**: Async (tokio), fast (<500ms p95), single binary
- **3 backends**: Static matcher (patterns), embedded ML (local), Ollama (optional)
- **Safety validation**: Blocks rm -rf, dd, privilege escalation, destructive ops
- **Cross-platform**: macOS (Intel/ARM), Linux (x86_64/ARM64)
- **Privacy-first**: No data collection by default, local-only inference

## Safety Design:

Every command goes through validation:
```rust
pub struct SafetyValidator {
    rules: Vec<SafetyRule>,
}

pub enum Severity {
    Block,    // Never allow (rm -rf /, dd, fork bombs)
    Warn,     // Show warning (sudo, chmod 777)
    Info,     // Informational
}
```

YOU approve before execution. Always.

## Current Limitations (Beta):

- Command coverage: ~75% of test cases (actively expanding)
- Platform detection: Works but not perfect (BSD vs GNU edge cases)
- LLM accuracy: Embedded models hallucinate on complex queries (~20%)

## Installation:

```bash
# Quick install:
curl -fsSL https://caro.sh/install.sh | sh

# From source:
cargo install caro
```

## Open Source:

- MIT licensed
- GitHub: [link]
- Contributions welcome (CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Feedback Welcome:

This is a beta. I'd love to hear:
- What works? What breaks?
- What commands would you use caro for?
- Any safety concerns?
- Performance issues?
