```

### Privacy Controls
```bash
# Export your telemetry data
caro telemetry export my-data.json

### Daily Status Update (Critical Period)

**Discord #announcements** (Critical issue discovered):
```markdown
## ⚠️ Caro Status Update: Investigating Issue

**Update**: Jan 17, 2026, 2:30 PM EST

We're investigating reports of command timeouts on slow networks ([#128](link)).

**Impact**:
- Affects ~5% of users (those on <2 Mbps connections)
- Commands take >30s to generate (should be <1s)
- No data loss or safety issues

**Workaround**:
Set a higher timeout:
```bash
caro config timeout 60  # 60 seconds instead of 30
```

**Status**:
- **Root cause**: Identified (LLM model download on first run)
- **Fix**: In progress (bundle model with installer)
- **ETA**: Patch release tomorrow (Jan 18)

**What You Can Do**:
- If affected, use the workaround above
- Report any other slow network issues: [#128](link)

We'll update this thread when the patch is ready. Thanks for your patience! 🙏

### Service Outage

**Discord #announcements**:
```markdown
## ⚠️ Service Outage: Install Script Unavailable

**Update**: Jan 20, 2026, 3:45 PM EST

Our install script endpoint (https://caro-cli.dev/install.sh) is currently unavailable due to CDN issues.

**Impact**:
- New users cannot install Caro via `curl | sh`
- Existing users are not affected
- Updates via `caro update` work normally

**Workaround**:
Install from GitHub releases:
```bash
# Download binary directly
wget https://github.com/caro-cli/caro/releases/download/v1.1.0-beta/caro-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

# Extract
tar -xzf caro-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

# Install
sudo mv caro /usr/local/bin/
```

**Status**:
- **Root cause**: CDN provider outage (not Caro-specific)
- **Fix**: Switching to backup CDN
- **ETA**: 1-2 hours

We'll update this thread when service is restored. Sorry for the inconvenience! 🙏

— Caro Team
