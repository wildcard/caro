## Content Strategy Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Education First, Promotion Second**
- Teach users how to use caro effectively (not just "download now")
- Solve real problems (show value, not features)
- Build trust through helpful content
- Promotion is a byproduct of education

**2. Show, Don't Just Tell**
- Every concept includes working examples
- GIFs/videos > screenshots > text-only
- Real-world use cases (not contrived demos)
- User-generated content amplification

**3. Multi-Format, Multi-Channel**
- Blog posts (long-form, SEO)
- Twitter threads (bite-sized, viral)
- YouTube videos (visual learners)
- Discord discussions (community)
- README/docs (reference)

**4. Consistent Voice, Diverse Perspectives**
- Friendly, technical, empowering (brand voice)
- Multiple authors (team, community, guest posts)
- Diverse use cases (DevOps, data science, sysadmin)

**5. Sustainable Cadence**
- Quality > quantity (1 great post/week > 7 mediocre)
- Evergreen content (timeless, not news)
- Repurpose content (blog → thread → video)
- Community contributions (not all from team)
