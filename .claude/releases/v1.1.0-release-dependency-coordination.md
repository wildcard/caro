## Dependency Overview

### What is a Dependency?

**Dependency**: Any task, resource, or deliverable that must be completed or available before another task can proceed

**Types**:
1. **Technical**: Code, libraries, infrastructure, tools
2. **Team**: Work from other team members, expertise, availability
3. **External**: Third-party services, vendors, partners
4. **Timeline**: Date-based constraints, event dependencies

**Why Manage Dependencies**:
- **Prevent Blockers**: Identify critical path, avoid bottlenecks
- **Coordinate Work**: Ensure teams work in right sequence
- **Manage Risk**: Dependencies are often sources of delays
- **Set Expectations**: Clear ownership, timelines, commitments

---

### Dependency Philosophy

**Principles**:
1. **Minimize Dependencies**: Fewer dependencies = less risk
2. **Make Explicit**: Document all dependencies, don't assume
3. **Track Actively**: Monitor status, escalate blockers early
4. **Plan for Failure**: Dependencies can fail, have contingencies
5. **Own End-to-End**: Don't let dependencies become excuses

**Anti-Patterns**:
- ❌ "We're blocked by X" (without escalation or mitigation)
- ❌ Hidden dependencies (discovered late)
- ❌ Circular dependencies (A needs B, B needs A)
- ❌ Single point of failure (only one person knows X)

---

## Technical Dependencies

### Code Dependencies (Rust Crates)

**Current Dependencies** (from Cargo.toml):

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.35", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
clap = { version = "4.4", features = ["derive"] }
regex = "1.10"
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
anyhow = "1.0"
thiserror = "1.0"
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-subscriber = "0.3"
```

**Dependency Management**:
- **Versions**: Locked in Cargo.lock (reproducible builds)
- **Updates**: Review before updating (breaking changes?)
- **Security**: `cargo audit` daily (known vulnerabilities)
- **License**: All MIT/Apache-2.0 compatible (no GPL)

---

### Critical Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose | Risk | Mitigation |
|------------|---------|------|------------|
| `tokio` | Async runtime | Medium (core infra) | Well-maintained, stable |
| `serde` | Serialization | Low (stable) | Industry standard |
| `clap` | CLI parsing | Low (stable) | Active maintenance |
| `reqwest` | HTTP client | Medium (network) | Fallback: no remote features |
| LLM model files | Inference | High (large files) | Bundle with binary, CDN fallback |

**Risk Assessment**:
- **High Risk**: LLM model files (large, must bundle correctly)
- **Medium Risk**: `tokio`, `reqwest` (core functionality)
- **Low Risk**: `serde`, `clap`, `regex` (stable, mature)

---

### Dependency Updates

**Update Policy**:
- **Security patches**: Apply immediately (P0)
- **Bug fixes**: Apply in patch releases (v1.1.1)
- **Feature updates**: Review for v1.2.0
- **Major version bumps**: Careful review, test thoroughly

**Before Updating**:
1. Check changelog (breaking changes?)
2. Review diff (what changed?)
3. Run tests (regressions?)
4. Update Cargo.lock
5. Commit separately (easy to revert)

**Example**:
```bash
# Check for outdated dependencies
cargo outdated

# Update specific dependency
cargo update -p tokio

# Test after update
cargo test --all

# Commit
git commit -m "deps: update tokio to 1.36 (security patch)"
```

---

### Infrastructure Dependencies

**Critical Infrastructure**:

| Service | Purpose | Owner | Dependency Type |
|---------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| GitHub | Code, CI/CD, Releases | GitHub | External |
| GitHub Actions | CI pipeline | GitHub | External |
| Cloudflare CDN | Binary distribution | Cloudflare | External |
| Vercel | Website, docs hosting | Vercel | External |
| Discord | Community chat | Discord | External |

**Availability Requirements**:
- **GitHub**: 99.9% uptime (release blocker if down)
- **CDN**: 99.9% uptime (install script fails if down)
- **CI**: 95% uptime (can retry builds)
- **Vercel**: 95% uptime (docs less critical)
- **Discord**: 90% uptime (community engagement)

---

### Tool Dependencies

**Development Tools** (required for contributions):

| Tool | Purpose | Version | Critical? |
|------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Rust | Compiler | 1.75+ | Yes |
| Cargo | Build system | Bundled with Rust | Yes |
| Git | Version control | 2.40+ | Yes |
| GitHub CLI | Release automation | 2.40+ | No (optional) |

**Optional Tools** (enhance workflow):
- `cargo-tarpaulin`: Test coverage
- `cargo-audit`: Security scanning
- `cargo-outdated`: Dependency updates
- `clippy`: Linting

**Onboarding**: All required tools documented in CONTRIBUTING.md

---

## Team Dependencies

### Work Dependencies (Critical Path)

**Release Critical Path** (must complete in sequence):

```
Planning (Jan 8)
    ↓
Beta Build (Jan 9)
    ↓
Beta Testing (Jan 10-12)  ← DEPENDS: Beta testers recruited
    ↓
Bug Fixes (Jan 13)        ← DEPENDS: Beta feedback
    ↓
Final Verification (Jan 14)
    ↓
Launch (Jan 15)           ← DEPENDS: All gates passed
```

**Parallel Tracks** (can proceed independently):
- Documentation (Comm Lead) → Can start early, update before launch
- Marketing Content (Comm Lead) → Can draft in advance
- Metrics Dashboard (Rel Manager) → Can set up anytime

---

### Team Dependencies Matrix

| Task | Owner | Depends On | Blocks |
|------|-------|------------|--------|
| Planning Complete | Rel Manager | - | Beta Build |
| Beta Build | Eng Lead | Planning | Beta Testing |
| Beta Tester Recruitment | Comm Lead | Planning | Beta Testing |
| Beta Testing | Beta Testers | Beta Build + Recruitment | Bug Fixes |
| Bug Fixes | Engineers | Beta Feedback | Final Verification |
| Documentation | Comm Lead | Beta Feedback (for accuracy) | Launch Announcements |
| Launch Announcements | Comm Lead | Documentation | Launch |
| Launch | Rel Manager | All Above | Post-Launch Support |

**Critical Dependencies**:
- **Beta Testing** depends on both Beta Build AND Tester Recruitment (parallel dependencies)
- **Launch** depends on ALL previous tasks (convergence point)

---

### Skill Dependencies

**Required Skills**:

| Skill | Needed For | Team Members | Bus Factor |
|-------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Rust development | Code, bug fixes | Eng Lead, 3 Engineers | 4 ✅ |
| Release management | Coordination | Rel Manager | 1 ⚠️ |
| Security/Privacy | Audits, validation | Sec Lead | 1 ⚠️ |
| Community management | Support, content | Comm Lead | 1 ⚠️ |
| Documentation writing | Docs, guides | Comm Lead, Engineers | 4 ✅ |

**Bus Factor Risks**:
- ⚠️ **Release Manager**: Only 1 person (train backup: Eng Lead)
- ⚠️ **Security Lead**: Only 1 person (train backup: Engineer A)
- ⚠️ **Community Lead**: Only 1 person (recruit volunteer helper)

**Mitigation**: Cross-training, documentation, shadowing

---

### Availability Dependencies

**Team Member Availability** (Jan 8 - Feb 15):

| Team Member | Role | Unavailable Dates | Impact |
|-------------|------|-------------------|--------|
| Rel Manager | Coordinator | None scheduled | - |
| Eng Lead | Technical | Jan 20-21 (weekend trip) | Low (post-launch) |
| Engineer A | Developer | None | - |
| Engineer B | Developer | Jan 18-19 (family event) | Low (post-launch) |
| Engineer C | Developer | Feb 1-7 (vacation) | Low (Week 3) |
| Comm Lead | Community | None scheduled | - |
| Sec Lead | Security | Jan 25-27 (conference) | Low (post-launch) |

**Coverage Plan**:
- **Launch Day (Jan 15)**: All critical members available ✅
- **Post-Launch**: Engineer B covers for Engineer C during vacation

---

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Services

**Critical External Dependencies**:

| Service | Status | SLA | Fallback |
|---------|--------|-----|----------|
| GitHub | Operational | 99.95% uptime | Wait (no alternative) |
| Cloudflare CDN | Operational | 100% uptime (historically) | GitHub Releases direct download |
| Vercel | Operational | 99.99% uptime | GitHub Pages (backup) |
| Discord | Operational | 99.9% uptime | Twitter for announcements |

**Monitoring**:
- **Status Pages**: Subscribe to status updates (GitHub, Cloudflare, Vercel, Discord)
- **Alerts**: Set up Slack alerts for outages
- **Contingency**: Document fallback for each service

---

### Beta Tester Dependencies

**Beta Tester Commitment**:

| Tester | Platform | Availability | Commitment |
|--------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Tester 1 | macOS | Jan 10-12 | Confirmed |
| Tester 2 | Linux (Ubuntu) | Jan 10-12 | Confirmed |
| Tester 3 | Linux (Arch) | Jan 10-12 | Tentative |
| Backup 1 | macOS | Jan 10-12 | Standby |
| Backup 2 | Linux | Jan 10-12 | Standby |

**Risk**: Tester drops out
**Mitigation**: Recruit 2 backups, confirm 24hr before beta

**Communication**:
- **T-2 days** (Jan 8): Confirm commitment
- **T-1 day** (Jan 9): Send testing guide
- **T-0** (Jan 10): Kickoff email, start testing

---

### Partner Dependencies

**Current Partners**: None (future consideration)

**Potential Partner Dependencies** (v1.2.0+):
- Integration partners (e.g., IDE plugins)
- Infrastructure sponsors (e.g., cloud credits)
- Media partners (e.g., tech blogs, podcasts)

**Coordination**: Not needed for v1.1.0-beta

---

## Timeline Dependencies

### Date-Based Constraints

**Fixed Dates**:
- **Jan 15** (Wednesday): Launch Day (chosen for mid-week, high engagement)
- **Jan 8-9** (Tue-Wed): Planning complete, beta recruitment
- **Jan 10-12** (Thu-Sat): Beta testing window (includes weekend for volunteers)

**Why These Dates**:
- **Mid-week launch**: Avoid Friday (low engagement, support unavailable over weekend)
- **Weekend beta testing**: Volunteers available outside work hours
- **Post-holiday**: Avoid Dec holidays, Jan 1 (people busy)

---

### Milestone Dependencies

**Release Milestones** (date-driven):

```
Jan 8 (T-7):  Planning Complete
    ↓
Jan 10 (T-5): Beta Testing Starts  ← DATE-DEPENDENT
    ↓
Jan 12 (T-3): Beta Testing Ends    ← DATE-DEPENDENT (3-day window)
    ↓
Jan 13 (T-2): Bug Fix Day
    ↓
Jan 14 (T-1): Final Verification
    ↓
Jan 15 (T-0): LAUNCH DAY           ← FIXED DATE
```

**Dependency Risk**:
- If beta testing delayed (e.g., testers unavailable), entire timeline shifts
- If critical bug found on T-1, must decide: Delay launch or ship with workaround

**Mitigation**: Buffer days built into timeline (T-3 to T-1 = 2 days for fixes)

---

## Dependency Risk Management

### High-Risk Dependencies

**Top 5 Dependency Risks**:

1. **Beta Testers Drop Out** (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High)
   - **Risk**: Cannot validate on both platforms
   - **Mitigation**: Recruit 2 backups per platform
   - **Contingency**: Internal team testing if all testers unavailable

2. **Critical Bug Found on T-1** (Likelihood: Low, Impact: Critical)
   - **Risk**: Cannot launch on Jan 15
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing during beta (Jan 10-12)
   - **Contingency**: Delay launch by 48 hours, communicate transparently

3. **GitHub Outage During Launch** (Likelihood: Very Low, Impact: High)
   - **Risk**: Cannot create release, users cannot download
   - **Mitigation**: Check GitHub status before launch
   - **Contingency**: Delay launch announcement until GitHub operational

4. **LLM Model File Corruption** (Likelihood: Low, Impact: Medium)
   - **Risk**: Command generation fails
   - **Mitigation**: Validate model files during build, checksum verification
   - **Contingency**: Re-bundle and re-upload, fallback to static matcher

5. **Release Manager Unavailable** (Likelihood: Very Low, Impact: High)
   - **Risk**: No coordination on launch day
   - **Mitigation**: Train backup (Eng Lead)
   - **Contingency**: Eng Lead takes over as acting Release Manager

---

### Dependency Risk Matrix

| Dependency | Risk Level | Mitigation Status | Owner |
|------------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Beta testers | Medium | Backups recruited | Comm Lead |
| GitHub availability | Low | Monitor status page | Rel Manager |
| LLM model files | Low | Checksum validation | Eng Lead |
| Team availability | Low | Coverage plan documented | Rel Manager |
| Critical bug T-1 | Medium | Extensive beta testing | Eng Lead |

**Review Cadence**: Daily during beta/launch, weekly post-launch

- `↑`: Convergence (all tasks must complete)

---

## Blocking Issues

### What is a Blocker?

**Blocker**: Any issue that prevents progress on critical path

**Examples**:
- ✅ Blocker: P0 bug prevents launch (blocks critical path)
- ✅ Blocker: Beta tester unavailable (blocks beta testing)
- ❌ Not a blocker: P3 bug (low priority, doesn't block launch)
- ❌ Not a blocker: Documentation typo (can fix post-launch)

---

### Blocker Management

**When Blocked**:
1. **Identify**: What task is blocked? What's blocking it?
2. **Escalate**: Notify Release Manager immediately
3. **Mitigate**: Can we work around? Parallel track?
4. **Resolve**: Focus resources on unblocking
5. **Update**: Communicate status to team

**Example**:
```
BLOCKER ALERT (Jan 12, 3 PM EST)

Task: Beta Testing
Blocker: Tester 1 (macOS) has emergency, unavailable

Impact: Cannot validate macOS compatibility

Mitigation:
- Contact Backup 1 (macOS) immediately
- If unavailable, internal team member tests macOS

Owner: Comm Lead (contacting backup)
ETA: Resolved by 6 PM EST or escalate to delay
```

---

### Blocker Escalation

**Escalation Path**:
1. **Team Member** identifies blocker → Notifies **Release Manager**
2. **Release Manager** assesses impact → Attempts resolution
3. If unresolvable within 4 hours → Escalates to **Project Lead**
4. **Project Lead** decides: Delay launch or continue with mitigation

**Critical Blockers** (Immediate escalation):
- P0 bug discovered on T-1 (Jan 14)
- Privacy audit fails (PII found)
- GitHub/CDN outage during launch
- Release Manager unavailable

---

## Dependency Resolution

### Resolution Strategies

**1. Remove Dependency** (Best)
- Refactor to eliminate dependency
- Make work independent
- Example: Parallelize tasks that were sequential

**2. Mitigate Dependency** (Good)
- Reduce risk, add fallback
- Example: Recruit backup beta testers

**3. Accept Dependency** (Acceptable)
- Monitor closely, plan for failure
- Example: GitHub dependency (no alternative, monitor status)

**4. Ignore Dependency** (Bad)
- Hope it doesn't fail
- Example: Not recruiting backup testers (risky)

---

### Dependency Reduction

**Before v1.1.0-beta**:
- 15 initial dependencies identified
- Reduced to 10 critical dependencies
- Added fallbacks for 8 dependencies

**How We Reduced**:
1. **Parallelized work**: Docs don't block beta testing
2. **Cross-trained team**: 2 people can handle most tasks
3. **Automated**: CI runs tests automatically (no manual dependency)
4. **Simplified scope**: Removed non-critical features

**Result**: More resilient release plan

---

### Dependency Retrospective

**After Release** (Feb 11 retrospective):
- Which dependencies caused issues?
- Which mitigation strategies worked?
- What can we improve for v1.2.0?

**Example Lessons**:
- "Backup beta testers saved us when Tester 1 dropped out"
- "Should have tested CDN cache invalidation earlier"
- "Cross-training Eng Lead as backup Release Manager was valuable"

---

## Summary

### Dependency Overview
