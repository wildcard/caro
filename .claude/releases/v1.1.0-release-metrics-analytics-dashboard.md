## Metrics Strategy

### Metrics Philosophy

**Principles**:
1. **Actionable**: Every metric should inform a decision
2. **Leading**: Focus on indicators that predict future outcomes
3. **Lagging**: Track results to validate strategy
4. **Balanced**: Don't optimize one metric at the expense of others
5. **Honest**: Don't game metrics—measure what matters

**What We Don't Measure**:
- Vanity metrics (social media likes, followers without engagement)
- Metrics we can't act on (external factors beyond our control)
- PII or user-specific data (privacy by design)

### North Star Metric

**Active Weekly Users (AWU)**:
- **Definition**: Number of users who generate ≥1 command per week
- **Why**: Directly measures product value (people use Caro to solve problems)
- **Target**: 500 AWU by end of v1.1.0-beta period (Feb 15, 2026)
- **Current**: 0 (pre-launch)

**Leading Indicators**:
1. **Downloads**: More downloads → more potential users
2. **Activation rate**: % of downloaders who generate first command within 24 hours
3. **Retention rate**: % of users who return Week 2 after first use

**Lagging Indicators**:
1. **Commands per user**: Higher usage = more value
2. **Satisfaction score**: Happy users → word-of-mouth growth
3. **Churn rate**: Users who stop using Caro

---

## Core Metrics

### 1. Downloads

**Definition**: Number of Caro installations via all channels

**Tracking**:
```bash
# Install script logs downloads
curl -fsSL https://caro-cli.dev/install.sh | sh
# Logs to: analytics.downloads.count(platform, version)

# GitHub releases track downloads automatically
# Access via GitHub API: GET /repos/caro-cli/caro/releases
```

**Targets**:
| Period | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Week 1 (Jan 15-21) | 200 | Beta launch, initial buzz |
| Week 2 (Jan 22-28) | 150 | Word-of-mouth growth |
| Week 3 (Jan 29-Feb 4) | 120 | Steady growth |
| Week 4 (Feb 5-11) | 100 | Plateau before v1.2.0 |
| **Total (4 weeks)** | **570** | Cumulative downloads |

**Breakdown**:
- **By platform**: macOS (60%), Linux (40%)
- **By channel**: Website (50%), GitHub (30%), Reddit (10%), Twitter (10%)

**Dashboard Query**:
```sql
SELECT
  DATE(timestamp) AS date,
  platform,
  COUNT(*) AS downloads
FROM analytics.downloads
WHERE timestamp >= '2026-01-15'
  AND timestamp < '2026-02-15'
GROUP BY date, platform
ORDER BY date, platform;
```

---

### 2. Active Weekly Users (AWU)

**Definition**: Users who generate ≥1 command in a 7-day period

**Tracking**:
```rust
// Track command generation (privacy-safe)
let event = TelemetryEvent {
    event_type: "command_generated",
    timestamp: Utc::now(),
    user_id: hash_user_id(),  // Anonymized, no PII
    platform: Platform::detect(),
    category: command.category,  // "file_management", "process_monitoring", etc.
};

// Do NOT track: actual command, file paths, user input
```

**Targets**:
| Week | Target AWU | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Week 1 (Jan 15-21) | 150 | 75% of 200 downloads activate |
| Week 2 (Jan 22-28) | 250 | +100 new, 67% W1 retention |
| Week 3 (Jan 29-Feb 4) | 350 | +100 new, 70% W2 retention |
| Week 4 (Feb 5-11) | 450 | +100 new, 72% W3 retention |
| **End of Beta (Feb 15)** | **500** | Final target |

**Dashboard Query**:
```sql
SELECT
  YEARWEEK(timestamp) AS week,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM analytics.command_generated
WHERE timestamp >= '2026-01-15'
  AND timestamp < '2026-02-15'
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week;
```

---

### 3. Activation Rate

**Definition**: % of users who generate ≥1 command within 24 hours of install

**Formula**:
```
Activation Rate = (Users who generate ≥1 command within 24hr) / (Total downloads) × 100%
```

**Target**: 75% (150 out of 200 Week 1 downloads)

**Tracking**:
```sql
WITH installs AS (
  SELECT user_id, MIN(timestamp) AS install_time
  FROM analytics.downloads
  GROUP BY user_id
),
first_command AS (
  SELECT user_id, MIN(timestamp) AS first_command_time
  FROM analytics.command_generated
  GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total_installs,
  COUNT(fc.user_id) AS activated_users,
  COUNT(fc.user_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS activation_rate
FROM installs i
LEFT JOIN first_command fc
  ON i.user_id = fc.user_id
  AND fc.first_command_time <= i.install_time + INTERVAL 24 HOUR
WHERE i.install_time >= '2026-01-15';
```

**Why It Matters**: Low activation = friction in onboarding (docs, UX, bugs)

---

### 4. Retention Rate

**Definition**: % of users who return in Week N after first use

**Cohort Analysis**:
```
┌────────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│ Cohort     │ Week 0  │ Week 1  │ Week 2  │ Week 3  │
├────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
│ Jan 15-21  │ 100%    │ 67%     │ 50%     │ 40%     │
│ Jan 22-28  │ 100%    │ 70%     │ 55%     │ -       │
│ Jan 29-Feb4│ 100%    │ 72%     │ -       │ -       │
│ Feb 5-11   │ 100%    │ -       │ -       │ -       │
└────────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

**Targets**:
- **Week 1 retention**: 67% (100 out of 150 W0 users return W1)
- **Week 2 retention**: 50% (75 out of 150 W0 users return W2)
- **Week 4 retention**: 30% (45 out of 150 W0 users return W4)

**Dashboard Query**:
```sql
WITH cohorts AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('week', MIN(timestamp)) AS cohort_week
  FROM analytics.command_generated
  GROUP BY user_id
),
activity AS (
  SELECT
    c.user_id,
    c.cohort_week,
    DATE_TRUNC('week', a.timestamp) AS activity_week,
    DATEDIFF('week', c.cohort_week, a.timestamp) AS week_number
  FROM cohorts c
  JOIN analytics.command_generated a ON c.user_id = a.user_id
)
SELECT
  cohort_week,
  week_number,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) * 100.0 / FIRST_VALUE(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)) OVER (PARTITION BY cohort_week ORDER BY week_number) AS retention_pct
FROM activity
GROUP BY cohort_week, week_number
ORDER BY cohort_week, week_number;
```

---

### 5. Commands Generated

**Definition**: Total number of commands generated across all users

**Tracking**:
```rust
let event = TelemetryEvent {
    event_type: "command_generated",
    category: command.category,  // "file_management", "process_monitoring", etc.
    platform: Platform::detect(),
    // Do NOT track: actual command text, user input
};
```

**Targets**:
| Week | Target Commands | Commands/User | Notes |
|------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| Week 1 | 1,200 | 8/user | Initial exploration |
| Week 2 | 2,000 | 8/user | Habit forming |
| Week 3 | 2,800 | 8/user | Regular usage |
| Week 4 | 3,600 | 8/user | Power users emerge |
| **Total** | **9,600** | **8/user avg** | 4-week total |

**Dashboard Query**:
```sql
SELECT
  DATE(timestamp) AS date,
  category,
  COUNT(*) AS command_count
FROM analytics.command_generated
WHERE timestamp >= '2026-01-15'
  AND timestamp < '2026-02-15'
GROUP BY date, category
ORDER BY date, category;
```

## Health Metrics

### 1. Command Success Rate

**Definition**: % of generated commands that execute successfully

**Tracking**:
```rust
// User feedback after execution (optional, user-initiated)
caro "show running processes"
# Command: ps aux
# Run this command? [y/n/e/c] y
# ... (command executes)
# Did this command work? [y/n] y  // <-- User feedback

let event = TelemetryEvent {
    event_type: "command_feedback",
    success: true,  // or false
    category: "process_monitoring",
};
```

**Target**: 85% success rate

**Why It Matters**: Low success rate = poor command quality, user frustration

**Dashboard Query**:
```sql
SELECT
  category,
  COUNT(*) AS total_feedback,
  SUM(CASE WHEN success = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successful,
  SUM(CASE WHEN success = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS success_rate
FROM analytics.command_feedback
WHERE timestamp >= '2026-01-15'
  AND timestamp < '2026-02-15'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY success_rate DESC;
```

---

### 2. Error Rate

**Definition**: % of command generation requests that fail with errors

**Tracking**:
```rust
// Track errors (no PII)
let event = TelemetryEvent {
    event_type: "command_generation_error",
    error_type: "timeout" | "parse_failure" | "llm_error" | "safety_blocked",
    platform: Platform::detect(),
};
```

**Target**: <5% error rate

**Breakdown**:
- **Timeout**: <1% (LLM takes too long)
- **Parse failure**: <1% (JSON output corrupted)
- **LLM error**: <2% (model returns error)
- **Safety blocked**: N/A (not an error, intentional)

**Dashboard Query**:
```sql
SELECT
  error_type,
  COUNT(*) AS error_count,
  COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM analytics.command_generated WHERE timestamp >= '2026-01-15') AS error_rate
FROM analytics.command_generation_error
WHERE timestamp >= '2026-01-15'
  AND timestamp < '2026-02-15'
GROUP BY error_type
ORDER BY error_count DESC;
```

---

### 3. Crash Rate

**Definition**: % of sessions that end with a crash

**Tracking**:
```rust
// Crash reporting (using existing tools like Sentry, or custom)
// Do NOT track: file paths, user input, environment variables

let crash_report = CrashReport {
    event_type: "crash",
    platform: Platform::detect(),
    version: env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"),
    stack_trace: sanitized_stack_trace(),  // No PII
};
```

**Target**: <0.1% crash rate (1 crash per 1,000 sessions)

**Dashboard Query**:
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total_crashes,
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM analytics.command_generated WHERE timestamp >= '2026-01-15') AS total_users,
  COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM analytics.command_generated WHERE timestamp >= '2026-01-15') AS crash_rate
FROM analytics.crashes
WHERE timestamp >= '2026-01-15'
  AND timestamp < '2026-02-15';
```

|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Overall | 84% | 80% | ✅ |
| Safety | 100% | 100% | ✅ |
| Privacy | 100% | 100% | ✅ |
| Core | 92% | 85% | ✅ |
| Utils | 76% | 70% | ✅ |

**Why It Matters**: Low coverage = higher risk of regressions

---
