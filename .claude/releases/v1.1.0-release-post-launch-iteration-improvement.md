## Post-Launch Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Ship Fast, Learn Faster**: Release early, gather feedback, iterate quickly
**2. User Voice First**: Prioritize real user needs over team assumptions
**3. Data-Informed Decisions**: Use metrics + qualitative feedback for decisions
**4. Incremental Improvement**: Small, frequent improvements over large infrequent ones
**5. Transparent Communication**: Share learnings publicly, build trust through honesty

### Iteration Mindset

```
Launch → Measure → Learn → Improve → Launch
   ↑___________________________________|
         (Continuous feedback loop)
```

**Not**: "Launch and done"
**But**: "Launch and iterate continuously"

### Success Metrics for Post-Launch

| Metric | Week 1 Target | Week 4 Target |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Active Weekly Users | 150 | 300 (2x growth) |
| Command Success Rate | 86.2% | 90%+ (improve quality) |
| User Retention (Week 2) | 60% | 70%+ (improve stickiness) |
| Bug Fix Cycle Time | <24h (P0) | <12h (P0) |
| Feature Velocity | 2 per week | 3-4 per week |

## Prioritization Framework

### RICE Scoring (Reach × Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort)

**Formula**: `RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort`

**Reach**: How many users affected? (Scale: 1-1000+)
**Impact**: How much does it move the needle? (Scale: 0.25 = minimal, 3 = massive)
**Confidence**: How sure are we? (Scale: 50% = low, 100% = high)
**Effort**: Person-weeks to implement (Scale: 0.5 = hours, 8 = months)

**Example 1: Fix major bug affecting file commands**
- Reach: 100 users (60% use file commands)
- Impact: 3 (massive - core functionality)
- Confidence: 100% (verified bug)
- Effort: 1 week
- RICE Score: (100 × 3 × 1.0) / 1 = **300** (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Example 2: Add colorful ASCII art to output**
- Reach: 162 users (all users)
- Impact: 0.25 (minimal - cosmetic)
- Confidence: 80% (some users may like)
- Effort: 0.5 weeks
- RICE Score: (162 × 0.25 × 0.8) / 0.5 = **65** (LOW PRIORITY)

**Example 3: Multi-step command chains**
- Reach: 50 users (30% have this workflow)
- Impact: 2 (large - new capability)
- Confidence: 60% (requested but unvalidated)
- Effort: 4 weeks
- RICE Score: (50 × 2 × 0.6) / 4 = **15** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### Priority Buckets

**P0 - Now** (RICE > 200):
- Critical bugs, security issues
- High-impact, low-effort wins
- Blockers for adoption

**P1 - Next** (RICE 100-200):
- Important features with clear demand
- Quality improvements
- Performance optimizations

**P2 - Soon** (RICE 50-100):
- Nice-to-have features
- Polish and refinement
- Technical debt

**P3 - Later** (RICE < 50):
- Low impact improvements
- Speculative features
- Future exploration

### Weekly Prioritization Meeting

**Monday 10:00 AM** (60 minutes):

1. **Review Feedback** (15 min):
   - Triage new issues, feature requests
   - Group by theme
   - Identify patterns

2. **Score Top Items** (20 min):
   - Apply RICE to top 10 items
   - Discuss assumptions
   - Validate with data

3. **Commit to Sprint** (15 min):
   - Select P0 items (must do)
   - Select P1 items (should do if time)
   - Defer P2/P3 to backlog

4. **Assign Owners** (10 min):
   - Each item has owner
   - Owners commit to timeline
   - Dependencies identified

**Output**: Sprint backlog with RICE scores, owners, due dates

- Smart defaults based on context (current directory)
- Better platform detection (detect shell, not just OS)
- Validation improvements (catch more dangerous patterns)
- Performance optimization (model loading, inference)

### Large Effort (3-4 weeks)

- Multi-step command chains ("find files and then...")
- Interactive refinement ("did you mean...?")
- Custom backend support (bring your own model)

- Web UI (browser-based interface)

### Blue Sky (Future exploration)

- Voice input (speak commands)
- IDE integration (VSCode, JetBrains)
