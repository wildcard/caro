## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Rating Matrix

**Impact Scale** (How bad if it happens):
- **Critical (5)**: Release must be cancelled or rolled back
- **High (4)**: Major user impact, significant effort to fix
- **Medium (3)**: Moderate user impact, manageable fix
- **Low (2)**: Minor user impact, easy fix
- **Negligible (1)**: No significant impact

**Likelihood Scale** (How likely to happen):
- **Very Likely (5)**: >50% probability
- **Likely (4)**: 25-50% probability
- **Possible (3)**: 10-25% probability
- **Unlikely (2)**: 1-10% probability
- **Rare (1)**: <1% probability

**Risk Score** = Impact × Likelihood

**Risk Levels**:
- **Critical (20-25)**: Immediate action required, block release
- **High (15-19)**: Action required before launch
- **Medium (8-14)**: Monitor and mitigate
- **Low (4-7)**: Accept or mitigate if easy
- **Negligible (1-3)**: Accept

**Escalation Triggers**:
- New **critical risk** (score ≥20) identified
- Existing risk **worsens** significantly (score +5 or more)
- **Mitigation fails** and no alternative available
- **Release gate blocked** by unresolved risk
