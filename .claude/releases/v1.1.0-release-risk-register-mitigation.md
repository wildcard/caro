## Risk Management Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Identify Risks Early**
- Better to know about risks upfront than be surprised later
- Regular risk review sessions (weekly during release cycle)
- Encourage team to raise concerns without fear
- "No such thing as a stupid risk to raise"

**2. Assess Objectively**
- Use data and past experience, not gut feelings alone
- Likelihood × Impact = Risk Score
- Avoid both over-worry (analysis paralysis) and under-worry (blind optimism)

**3. Mitigate Proactively**
- Address high-risk items before they become issues
- Some risks require prevention, others require preparedness
- "Hope is not a strategy" - always have Plan B

**4. Accept Some Risk**
- Not all risks can be eliminated (nor should they be)
- Balance risk mitigation with speed and innovation
- Explicit risk acceptance decisions (documented, not ignored)

**5. Learn from Realized Risks**
- When risks become issues, document what happened
- Update risk register for future releases
- Retrospective: "What risks did we miss? Why?"

---

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Scoring Matrix

**Likelihood** (1-5):
- 1 = Very Unlikely (<10% chance)
- 2 = Unlikely (10-30% chance)
- 3 = Possible (30-50% chance)
- 4 = Likely (50-80% chance)
- 5 = Very Likely (>80% chance)

**Impact** (1-5):
- 1 = Minimal (minor inconvenience, no schedule impact)
- 2 = Low (small delay, limited user impact)
- 3 = Medium (days of delay, noticeable user impact)
- 4 = High (weeks of delay, significant user impact, reputation damage)
- 5 = Critical (release blocked, major user harm, legal/security issues)

**Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact** (1-25 scale)

---

### Risk Priority Matrix

```
         HIGH IMPACT (4-5)
              │
   HIGH RISK  │  CRITICAL RISK
   (12-15)    │  (16-25)
              │
──────────────┼──────────────────
              │
   MEDIUM     │  HIGH RISK
   RISK (6-11)│  (12-15)
              │
         LOW IMPACT (1-3)

   LOW        MEDIUM    HIGH
   LIKELIHOOD LIKELIHOOD LIKELIHOOD
```

**Risk Categories**:
- **Critical Risk (16-25)**: Immediate action required, escalate to Release Manager
- **High Risk (12-15)**: Prioritize mitigation, monitor closely
- **Medium Risk (6-11)**: Develop mitigation plan, review weekly
- **Low Risk (1-5)**: Accept or monitor, no immediate action

## Risk Monitoring & Tracking

### Weekly Risk Review (Every Monday, 30 minutes)

**Attendees**: Release Manager, Engineering Lead, Community Lead, Security Lead

**Agenda**:
1. **Review Existing Risks** (15 min)
   - Any risks materialized? (status update)
   - Likelihood or impact changed? (re-score if needed)
   - New mitigation strategies? (update register)

2. **Identify New Risks** (10 min)
   - What new risks emerged this week?
   - Add to risk register with scoring

3. **Action Items** (5 min)
   - Who owns what mitigation tasks?
   - Due dates for high-risk mitigations

**Output**: Updated risk register (commit to `.claude/releases/risks/weekly-review-YYYY-MM-DD.md`)

---

### Risk Dashboard (Real-Time Monitoring)

**Metrics to Monitor**:
- Open P0/P1 issues (indicator of technical risks materializing)
- Error rates (indicator of quality risks)
- Support volume (indicator of UX or documentation risks)
- Team velocity (indicator of burnout or capacity risks)
- Community sentiment (indicator of adoption or reputation risks)

**Alerts**:
- P0 issue opened → Alert Release Manager immediately
- Error rate >10% → Alert Engineering Lead
- Support volume >2x average → Alert Community Lead

---

## Mitigation Strategies

### Preventive Mitigation (Reduce Likelihood)

**Example: Comprehensive Testing (Reduces RISK-TECH-001)**
- Action: 500+ unit tests, 150+ integration tests, E2E scenarios
- Impact: Reduces likelihood of critical bugs from 4 (Likely) to 3 (Possible)
- Cost: Time and effort upfront
- ROI: High (bugs caught early are 10x cheaper to fix)

---

### Detective Mitigation (Early Detection)

**Example: CI/CD Performance Benchmarks (Detects RISK-TECH-002)**
- Action: Automated benchmarks fail build if >10% regression
- Impact: Detects performance issues before they reach users
- Cost: Minimal (automated)
- ROI: High (prevents bad releases)

---

### Corrective Mitigation (Reduce Impact)

**Example: Staged Rollout (Reduces RISK-TECH-001 impact)**
- Action: 1% → 5% → 25% → 50% → 100% rollout
- Impact: Limits blast radius (if bug exists, only 1% affected initially)
- Cost: Slightly slower adoption curve
- ROI: Very High (prevents catastrophic failures)

---

## Contingency Plans

### Contingency Plan Template

```markdown
## Contingency Plan: [Risk ID]

**Trigger**: [When to activate this plan]

**Steps**:
1. [Immediate action, 0-5 minutes]
2. [Short-term action, 5-60 minutes]
3. [Long-term action, 1-24 hours]

**Success Criteria**: [How do we know it worked?]

**Rollback Plan**: [If contingency fails, what's Plan C?]

**Owner**: [Who executes this plan?]
```

---

### Example: Contingency Plan for RISK-TECH-001 (Critical Bug Post-Launch)

**Trigger**: P0 bug reported by multiple users, core functionality broken

**Steps**:
1. **Immediate (0-15 min)**: Acknowledge bug publicly, assure users we're on it
2. **Short-term (15-60 min)**: Engineering Lead reproduces bug, identifies root cause
3. **Medium-term (1-4 hours)**: Develop hotfix, test on affected platforms
4. **Long-term (4-24 hours)**: Release v1.1.0-hotfix-1, notify users, post-mortem

**Success Criteria**: Bug fixed, users can resume normal usage, trust maintained

**Rollback Plan**: If hotfix doesn't work, rollback to v1.0.0 (advise users to downgrade)

**Owner**: Engineering Lead (execution), Release Manager (communication)

---

## Risk Communication

### Internal Communication (To Team)

**Weekly Risk Review Summary** (Sent to #release-team after each review):
```
## Risk Review Summary: Week 1, Day 3

**Risks Materialized**: None ✅

**Risk Status Changes**:
- RISK-PEOPLE-002 (Burnout): Likelihood increased from 2 to 3 (team working late nights)
  Action: Release Manager to check in with team, remind them to take breaks

**New Risks Identified**:
- RISK-TECH-006: macOS 14 Sonoma compatibility issue reported by beta tester
  Score: 6 (Medium Risk)
  Owner: Platform Engineer

**High Priority Risks (Score 12+)**:
- RISK-TECH-001: Critical Bug Post-Launch (Score 12) - Mitigation on track
- RISK-PEOPLE-002: Team Burnout (Score 12) - Requires attention

**Next Steps**:
- Platform Engineer: Investigate macOS 14 issue by EOD
- Release Manager: 1:1 check-ins with team on workload
```

---

### External Communication (To Users/Stakeholders)

**Only communicate risks if**:
- Risk has materialized and affects users
- Transparency is required (security vulnerability, privacy breach)
- Proactive communication prevents panic (known issue, fix in progress)

**Don't communicate risks that**:
- Are internal (burnout, team capacity)
- Are speculative (might never happen)
- Would cause unnecessary alarm (security risks before mitigation)

**Example External Communication** (If RISK-TECH-001 materializes):
```
## Incident Update: Critical Bug in v1.1.0-beta

We've identified a critical bug affecting command generation on macOS Intel.

**What happened**: Commands with special characters fail to generate.

**Who's affected**: macOS Intel users (approximately 30% of users)

**What we're doing**: Hotfix in progress, ETA 2 hours

**Workaround**: Use static matcher queries ("list files") or switch to embedded backend

**Next steps**: We'll release v1.1.0-hotfix-1 within 4 hours and notify all affected users

We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience.

— The Caro Team
