## Reporting Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Transparency**: Share good news and bad news equally, no surprises
**2. Data-Driven**: Metrics over opinions, evidence over assumptions
**3. Actionable**: Every report includes next steps, decisions needed
**4. Appropriate Depth**: Match detail to audience (executive vs team)
**5. Regular Cadence**: Predictable schedule, avoid reporting fatigue

### Reporting Pyramid

**Date**: [Date]

**Period**: [Date Range]

---

## The Bottom Line

**Status**: ✅ Successfully launched on January 15, 2026
**Users**: 162 Active Weekly Users (108% of 150 target)
**Quality**: 86.8% command success rate (above 86.2% target)
**Community**: 623 messages/week (125% of 500 target)

---

## What We Achieved

- Launched first public beta to 162 active users (8% above target)
- Maintained 86.8% command success rate (quality goal exceeded)
- Zero P0 security incidents (perfect safety record)
- Built engaged community: 500+ Discord members, 200+ GitHub stars
- Established repeatable release process (101 planning documents)

---

## Key Learnings

**What Worked**:
- Beta testing cycles caught 90% of bugs before launch
- Static matcher + embedded backend = fast + quality
- Community-first approach built organic advocacy

**What We'll Improve**:
- Earlier performance testing (caught regression late)
- More diverse beta tester profiles (underrepresented Windows)
- Better load testing (didn't anticipate 162 users)

---

## Next Steps

**v1.2.0 Planning** (February-March):
- Multi-step command chains (top user request)
- Windows support (expand addressable market)
- Shell integration (bash/zsh/fish plugins)
- Performance optimization (target <50ms for static)

**Go/No-Go for v1.2.0**: February 15, 2026

---

## Budget & Resources

**Actual Spend**: $46 (domain + code signing)
**Volunteer Hours**: 1,025 hours ($114,500 market value)
**ROI**: If saves 10k users 10 min/day = break-even in 5 days

**v1.2.0 Budget Request**: $100 (testing hardware) + volunteer hours
```

**Distribution**: Executive team, board (if applicable)
