## Success Framework

### Definition of Success

**Success = Meeting or exceeding predefined criteria across multiple dimensions**

**Dimensions**:
1. **Technical Quality**: Code works correctly, reliably, securely
2. **User Value**: Users achieve their goals, solve their problems
3. **Community Health**: Community grows, engages, contributes
4. **Team Sustainability**: Team is energized, not burned out
5. **Strategic Alignment**: Release advances project vision

**Not Success**:
- Launching on time but with critical bugs
- High downloads but low retention (vanity metrics)
- Happy users but burned out team
- Technical excellence but no user adoption

---

### Success Philosophy

**Principles**:
1. **User-Centric**: Success measured by user outcomes, not output
2. **Data-Driven**: Quantifiable metrics, not gut feel
3. **Balanced**: Multiple dimensions (quality, adoption, sustainability)
4. **Realistic**: Targets are ambitious but achievable
5. **Iterative**: Success evolves (v1.1.0 criteria differ from v1.2.0)

**Anti-Patterns**:
- ❌ "We launched, so we succeeded" (output, not outcome)
- ❌ "100% test coverage" (means vs ends)
- ❌ "1,000 GitHub stars" (vanity metric, not user value)
- ❌ "Released on deadline at all costs" (ignores quality/team health)
