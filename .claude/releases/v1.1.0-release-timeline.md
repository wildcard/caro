   - Mitigation: Multi-layer validation, daily audits
   - Contingency: Emergency stop, fix validation, re-test

3. **P0 Bugs During Beta (Jan 13-17)**
   - Risk: Critical bug discovered
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive pre-testing, incident response plan
   - Contingency: Hot-fix within 4 hours, extend beta if needed

4. **Go/No-Go Decision (Jan 23)**
