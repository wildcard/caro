**Q: What if download numbers are below target?**
A: Review metrics dashboard to identify cause (CDN issues? Low awareness?). Adjust marketing strategy.

**Q: What if a user reports PII in telemetry?**
A: Treat as P0 security incident. Disable telemetry immediately, investigate, delete data, patch, communicate.

**Q: What if release manager is unavailable?**
A: Backup release manager (Engineering Lead) takes over. All procedures documented.
