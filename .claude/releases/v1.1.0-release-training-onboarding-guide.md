## Onboarding Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Learn by Doing**: Hands-on tasks from day one, paired with experienced team members
**2. Progressive Disclosure**: Start with essentials, layer in complexity over time
**3. Documentation First**: Everything is documented, accessible, searchable
**4. Async-Friendly**: Self-paced learning, recorded sessions, written guides
**5. Psychological Safety**: Questions encouraged, mistakes are learning opportunities

### Time to Productivity Targets

| Role | Day 1 | Week 1 | Week 2 |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| Contributor (Code) | Read docs, setup env | First PR merged | Independent work |
| Contributor (Docs) | Read guidelines | First doc PR | Multiple PRs |
| Community Moderator | Read policies | Shadow veteran | Independent moderation |
| Beta Tester | Install caro, run tests | Submit 5+ bug reports | Write test cases |
| Release Team | Read planning docs | Attend meetings | Own workstream |

### Quality Assurance / Beta Tester

**Week 1: Testing Fundamentals**
- Day 1: Install caro, run through all installation methods
- Day 2: Run automated test suite: `cargo test --all-features`
- Day 3: Read `.claude/beta-testing/test-cases.yaml` - Understand test structure
- Day 4: Manual testing - Run 20 test cases, document results
- Day 5: Submit first bug report using template

**Week 2: Advanced Testing**
- Day 1-2: Read `v1.1.0-quality-assurance-testing-strategy.md`
- Day 3-4: Design new test cases for edge cases
- Day 5: Participate in beta test cycle meeting

**Key Skills to Develop**:
- Exploratory testing techniques
- Writing clear, reproducible bug reports
- Understanding test categories (smoke, functional, edge cases)
- Platform-specific testing (macOS vs Linux, Intel vs ARM)

**Bug Report Template**:
```markdown
## Bug Report

**Test Case ID**: bt_XXX (if applicable)
**caro Version**: `caro --version`
**Platform**: macOS 14.1 / Ubuntu 22.04 / etc.
**Backend**: static / embedded / ollama

**Natural Language Input**:
"find files larger than 100MB"

**Expected Behavior**:
Should generate: `find . -type f -size +100M`

**Actual Behavior**:
Generated: `find . -type f -size 100M` (missing '+' prefix)

**Impact**: 
Command returns no results even when large files exist.

**Severity**: Medium (incorrect output, but safe)

**Reproducibility**: 100% (every time)

**Additional Context**:
- Only affects size-based queries
- Works correctly for "files smaller than"
```

"Thanks for reporting this! caro requires Rust 1.70 or later. Can you check 
your version with `rustc --version`?

If it's older, you can update with:
`rustup update stable`

If you're still having issues, could you share:
- Your OS and version
- Full error message
- Output of `rustc --version`

We'll get you up and running!"
```

**Scenario 2: Command Not Working**
```

Response:
"Sorry about that! This helps us improve. Could you share:
- The natural language query you used
- The command caro generated
- The error message you got
- Your OS (macOS/Linux/etc.)

Meanwhile, you can try:
1. Adding more details to your query
2. Using --backend embedded (if you used static)

**Key Modules**:

1. **Agent** (`src/agent/mod.rs`):
   - Orchestrates the command generation flow
   - Backend selection logic
   - Validation integration
   - Error handling

2. **Backends** (`src/backends/`):
   - `InferenceBackend` trait (abstraction)
   - Static matcher (pattern-based, fast)
   - Embedded backend (SmolLM/Qwen, good quality)
   - Ollama backend (custom models, best quality)

3. **Safety** (`src/safety/`):
   - Command validation (syntax, safety, platform)
   - Dangerous pattern detection (rm -rf, curl | sh, etc.)
   - User approval flow

4. **Prompts** (`src/prompts/`):
   - Platform-aware prompt construction
   - Few-shot examples
   - Chain-of-thought reasoning
   - Negative examples

**Data Flow**:
```
User Input ("find large files")
    ↓
Agent.process_query()
    ↓
Backend Selection (static → embedded → ollama)
    ↓
Prompt Construction (platform-aware, few-shot examples)
    ↓
Model Inference (generate command)
    ↓
Safety Validation (check for dangerous patterns)
    ↓
User Approval (if needed)
    ↓
Return Result {"cmd": "find . -type f -size +100M"}
```

Q: I found a bug in the documentation. Should I fix it?
A: Yes! Small fixes don't need approval. Just submit a PR.

Q: Can I work on features not in the v1.1.0 scope?
A: After v1.1.0 launch (Jan 15), yes! Before launch, focus on release-critical work.

Q: I'm stuck. Who do I ask?
A: Ask in #development on Discord. If urgent, tag @Engineering Lead.

**Technical**:

Q: Which Rust version do I need?
A: 1.70 or later. Check with `rustc --version`.

Q: Tests are failing locally but pass in CI. Why?
A: Check for platform-specific behavior. You may be on macOS, CI tests Linux too.

Q: Can I add a new dependency?
A: Needs approval. Read `v1.1.0-release-dependency-management-third-party.md` first.

Q: How do I run tests for a specific module?
A: `cargo test --package caro --lib safety::tests` (example for safety module)

**Process**:

Q: How long until my PR is reviewed?
A: Target: <24 hours for first review. Complex PRs may take 2-3 days.
