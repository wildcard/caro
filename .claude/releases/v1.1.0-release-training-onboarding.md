## Training Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Learn by Doing**
- Theory is important, but practice is essential
- Hands-on exercises for every key procedure
- Shadow experienced team members before going solo
- Simulated scenarios (practice launches, mock incidents)

**2. Progressive Disclosure**
- Start with high-level overview (release goals, timeline)
- Dive into role-specific responsibilities
- Master critical procedures first (launch, incidents)
- Learn nice-to-have skills later (advanced monitoring, optimization)

**3. Just-in-Time Training**
- Train when needed, not months in advance
- Week 1 Day 1: Release overview, team roles
- Week 1 Day 2-4: Role-specific procedures
- Week 1 Day 5: Launch dry run, incident simulations

**4. Documentation-First**
- All procedures documented before training begins
- Training reinforces what's already written
- Participants reference docs during exercises
- Goal: Self-sufficient with documentation

**5. Psychological Safety**
- Questions are encouraged, no "stupid questions"
- Mistakes during training are learning opportunities
- Buddy system for support and guidance
- Clear escalation path if uncertain
