## Overview

This document identifies all significant risks to the v1.1.0-beta release, assesses their likelihood and impact, and provides detailed mitigation and contingency plans.

**Risk Management Philosophy**: Identify early, mitigate proactively, respond decisively.

---

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Severity Matrix

| Impact ↓ / Likelihood → | Low (1) | Medium (2) | High (3) |
|-------------------------|---------|------------|----------|
| **Critical (3)** | Medium Risk | High Risk | **CRITICAL RISK** |
| **High (2)** | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk |
| **Medium (1)** | Low Risk | Low Risk | Medium Risk |

**Risk Score** = Impact × Likelihood (1-9 scale)

**Risk Categories**:
- **CRITICAL (8-9)**: Immediate escalation, blocks release
- **HIGH (6-7)**: Active monitoring, mitigation required
- **MEDIUM (3-5)**: Monitored, mitigation planned
- **LOW (1-2)**: Accepted, documented

---

## Active Risks (Tracked in Risk Register)

### Risk 1: Privacy Violation (PII in Telemetry)

**Risk Score**: 9 (Critical × High) - **CRITICAL RISK**

**Description**: Personally identifiable information (PII) leaks into telemetry data despite validation layers.

**Impact**: CRITICAL
- Immediate release block
- Legal compliance issues (GDPR, CCPA)
- Complete loss of user trust
- Potential security incident disclosure requirements
- Project reputation permanently damaged

**Likelihood**: Low (with mitigations)
- 3 validation layers implemented
- 220+ automated tests
- Manual audits scheduled
- But: Complex regex patterns, edge cases possible

**Indicators**:
- PII found during privacy audit
- User reports seeing personal data in exports
- Automated tests fail
- Regex patterns miss edge cases

**Mitigation Strategies**:

**Pre-Beta** (Complete):
- ✅ Type system prevents direct PII storage
- ✅ Regex validation for 5+ PII types
- ✅ Manual audit procedure established
- ✅ 220+ privacy tests passing

**During Beta** (Jan 13-17):
- Manual privacy audit on ALL exports (Jan 12, 15, 17)
- Beta testers instructed to report any PII concerns immediately
- Emergency contact: beta@caro.sh marked "[PRIVACY URGENT]"

**Contingency Plan** (If PII Found):

**Immediate Actions** (< 15 minutes):
1. STOP all telemetry collection immediately
   ```bash
   # Disable telemetry in all beta builds
   git revert [telemetry-feature-commit]
   git push
   ```
2. Email ALL beta testers: "URGENT: Stop using Caro immediately"
3. Delete all collected telemetry data (irreversible)
4. Document exactly what PII was exposed

**Short-term Actions** (< 4 hours):
1. Investigate: How did PII bypass validation?
2. Fix: Strengthen validation layers
3. Test: Comprehensive validation of fix
4. Re-audit: Manual review of new implementation

**Communication**:
- Internal: Immediate escalation to project lead
- Beta testers: Transparent disclosure within 15 minutes
- Public: If required by law (privacy counsel advised)

**Release Impact**: **BLOCKS release until fixed and verified safe**

**Status**: ✅ Mitigated (3 layers active, audits scheduled)

---

### Risk 2: Insufficient Beta Tester Recruitment

**Risk Score**: 6 (High × Medium) - **HIGH RISK**

**Description**: Fail to recruit 3-5 quality beta testers by Jan 11.

**Impact**: HIGH
- Insufficient diversity in testing (platform, experience)
- Weak feedback quality
- Low confidence in go/no-go decision
- Possible delay to Jan 24 release

**Likelihood**: Medium
- Small community (early project)
- Tight timeline (2 days recruitment)
- Requires platform/experience diversity
- Time commitment (5 days, 30 min/day)

**Indicators**:
- < 5 applications by Jan 10 evening
- All applicants same platform (all macOS or all Linux)
- All applicants same experience level
- No applicants from target use cases

**Mitigation Strategies**:

**Multiple Recruitment Channels**:
- ✅ Personal outreach (5-8 individuals from network)
- ✅ GitHub Discussions (public recruitment)
- ✅ Social media (Twitter/X, Reddit)
- ✅ Multiple communities (r/rust, r/commandline)

**Attractive Value Proposition**:
- Clear time commitment (5 days, 30 min/day)
- Early access to features
- Direct impact on product
- Public acknowledgment

**Timeline Buffer**:
- Jan 10-11: 2 full days for recruitment
- Can extend to Jan 12 morning if needed (reduces setup time)

**Contingency Plan** (If Insufficient Applications):

**If < 3 applicants by Jan 10 evening**:
1. Extend recruitment to Jan 12 morning
2. Direct personal outreach to known CLI users
3. Consider reducing time commitment (3 days instead of 5)
4. Offer additional incentives (swag, early contributor status)

**If diversity gaps** (all same platform/experience):
1. Target recruitment to fill gaps
2. Accept slightly more testers (5-7 instead of 3-5)
3. Explicitly request diverse scenarios in testing

**If quality concerns** (inexperienced applicants only):
1. Adjust testing approach (more guided, less exploratory)
2. Provide detailed test scripts
3. Increase support availability

**Absolute Minimum**: 2 testers (1 macOS, 1 Linux)
- Below this: Delay beta to recruit properly
- Not worth releasing with single-platform testing

**Release Impact**: Could delay Jan 24 release by 1 week if recruitment fails completely

**Status**: ⏸️ Pending (recruitment starts Jan 10)
