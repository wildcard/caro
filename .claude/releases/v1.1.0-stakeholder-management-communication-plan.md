## Communication Strategy

### Communication Principles

**1. Transparency**
- Share both successes and challenges openly
- Admit mistakes, explain learnings
- No hidden agendas or surprise announcements

**2. Consistency**
- Same message across all channels (no contradictions)
- Regular cadence (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Predictable timing (e.g., Friday 4 PM for weekly updates)

**3. Timeliness**

- Respond quickly to questions (within 24-48 hours)
- Update stakeholders on progress (don't go dark)

**4. Relevance**
- Tailor content to stakeholder interests
- Avoid information overload (respect attention)
- Signal-to-noise ratio: High value, low volume

**5. Two-Way**
- Listen actively to stakeholder feedback
- Incorporate feedback into decisions
- Close the feedback loop (tell them what you did)

---

- Who is affected?
- What is the impact?
- What is the urgency?

**Step 2: Attempt Resolution** (within SLA)
- Can this be resolved without escalation?
- What resources are needed?
- Who can help?

**Step 3: Escalate** (if unresolved)
- Notify escalation point (Slack, email, call if urgent)
- Provide context (issue, impact, attempts to resolve)
- Request decision or resources

**Step 4: Follow Up** (after resolution)
- Communicate resolution to affected stakeholders
- Document lesson learned
- Update procedures if needed

## Feedback Management

### Feedback Channels

2. GitHub Issues (bug reports, feature requests)
3. Twitter mentions and DMs
4. Reddit comments
5. Email (beta@, support@)
6. In-app surveys

---

### Feedback Triage

**Process** (daily review, 30 minutes):

**Step 1: Collect** (aggregate from all channels)
**Step 2: Categorize**:
- Bug report → GitHub issue
- Feature request → GitHub discussion
- Support question → Discord #help or respond directly
- Praise/testimonial → Save for marketing
- Complaint → Respond, investigate root cause

**Step 3: Prioritize**:
- P0: Release blocker (act immediately)
- P1: Significant pain point (act within 24 hours)
- P2: Important but not urgent (act within 1 week)
- P3: Nice to have (backlog)

**Step 4: Respond** (within SLA):
- Acknowledge feedback within 24 hours
- Provide timeline for resolution (if applicable)
- Thank user for feedback

**Step 5: Close Loop** (after action):
- Notify user when issue resolved
- Ask if resolution satisfactory
- Incorporate learning into process

---

### Feedback Analysis

**Weekly** (30 minutes):
- Review feedback trends (common themes?)
- Quantify (how many users reporting X?)
- Share insights with team

**Example**:
> Week 1 feedback summary:
> - 23 support questions (most common: "How do I uninstall?")
> - 8 bug reports (5 P3, 2 P2, 1 P1)
> - 12 feature requests (top: shell history integration)
