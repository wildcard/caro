## Support Vision

### Mission
**"Ensure every Caro user gets unstuck quickly, learns something in the process, and feels valued by our community."**

### Support Goals
1. **Fast Response**: Acknowledge every issue within 2 hours (work hours)
2. **High Resolution**: Solve >90% of issues within 24 hours
3. **Educational**: Users learn, not just get answers
4. **Community-Driven**: Empower community to help each other
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Use support data to improve product

### Support Values
- **Patient**: Never make users feel stupid
- **Thorough**: Understand root cause, don't just patch symptoms
- **Transparent**: Honest about bugs, limitations, timelines
- **Proactive**: Anticipate issues, document before users ask
- **Grateful**: Thank users for reporting issues (they're helping us improve)

---

## Support Principles

### 1. Users Are Helping Us, Not Bothering Us

**Mindset**: Every bug report, question, or complaint is valuable feedback.

**How We Show It**:
- Thank users for reporting issues: "Thanks for catching this!"
- Credit users in release notes: "Fixed issue reported by @username"
- Never say "This is documented" (even if it is—link + apologize for not being clear)

**Good Response**:
```
Thanks for reporting this! You're right—that's a bug.

I've filed an issue: #123

We'll fix it in v1.1.1 (target: next week). I'll ping you when it's released.

Workaround for now: [temporary solution]
```

**Bad Response**:
```
This is already documented in the README. Please read the docs before asking.
```

---

### 2. Understand Before Answering

**Principle**: Ask clarifying questions before jumping to solutions.

**Troubleshooting Questions**:
1. What were you trying to do? (goal)
2. What command did you run? (action)
3. What happened? (actual result)
4. What did you expect? (expected result)
5. Platform & version? (`caro --version`, `uname -a`)

**Example**:
```
User: "Caro isn't working!"

Support (Bad): "Try reinstalling."

Support (Good):
"I'll help you troubleshoot. Can you share:
1. What command did you run?
2. What error message did you see?
3. Your platform: `uname -a`
4. Caro version: `caro --version`

This will help me pinpoint the issue."
```

---

### 3. Teach, Don't Just Tell

**Principle**: Explain the why, not just the how.

**Good Response**:
```
The issue is that `find` on macOS uses BSD syntax, which doesn't support `-printf`.

BSD alternative: find . -exec ls -l {} \;
Or use `-print0 | xargs -0 ls -l` for better handling of spaces.

Caro handles this automatically by detecting your platform.

```

**Bad Response**:
```
Use this command: find . -exec ls -l {} \;
```

---

### 4. Fix the Product, Not Just the Issue

**Principle**: If multiple users ask the same question, it's a product problem.

**Process**:
1. Answer the user immediately (short-term fix)
2. File a product issue (long-term fix)
3. Update documentation (prevent future questions)
4. Consider UX improvement (make it obvious)

**Example**:
```
User asks: "How do I disable telemetry?"

Response:
"Great question! Telemetry is opt-in (disabled by default).

To check status: `caro config telemetry --status`
To disable: `caro config telemetry --disable`

I'll update our README to make this more prominent. Thanks for asking!"

[Internally: File issue "Make telemetry status more discoverable"]
```

## Troubleshooting Process

### Standard Troubleshooting Steps

**Step 1: Gather Information** (5 min)
```
Support: "Thanks for reporting! To troubleshoot, I need:

1. Caro version: `caro --version`
2. Platform: `uname -a`
3. Your query (natural language)
4. Generated command (what Caro gave you)
5. Error message (if any)

This helps me reproduce the issue."
```

**Step 2: Reproduce Locally** (10-15 min)
- Use same platform (Docker if needed)
- Run same query
- Compare output

**Step 3: Identify Root Cause** (15-30 min)
- Check logs (if telemetry enabled)
- Review code (command generation, safety validation)
- Test variations (does it fail consistently?)

**Step 4: Provide Solution** (5 min)
```
Support: "Found the issue! [Root cause explanation]

Workaround (immediate):
[Temporary solution]

Permanent fix:
I've filed issue #123. We'll fix this in v1.1.1 (ETA: next week).

Does the workaround help for now?"
```

**Step 5: Follow Up** (1-2 days later)
```
Support: "Hi [user]! Wanted to let you know we fixed the issue
you reported in v1.1.1, released today.

Thanks again for reporting—you made Caro better for everyone! 🙏"
```

### Troubleshooting Checklist

**Before Asking User**:
- [ ] Check known issues (KNOWN_ISSUES.md)
- [ ] Search closed GitHub issues (might be duplicate)
- [ ] Check Discord history (has this been answered before?)

**Questions to Ask**:
- [ ] Platform (macOS/Linux, version)
- [ ] Caro version
- [ ] Exact query (natural language)
- [ ] Generated command
- [ ] Error message (full text)

**During Troubleshooting**:
- [ ] Reproduce locally (same platform, same query)
- [ ] Check logs (if user has telemetry enabled)
- [ ] Test variations (similar queries, different platforms)

**After Resolution**:
- [ ] Update known issues (if common)
- [ ] Update docs (if unclear)
- [ ] File product issue (if product problem)
- [ ] Follow up with user (after fix deployed)

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Caro: command not found"

**Root Cause**: Binary not in PATH

**Solution**:
```
1. Check installation:
   - Homebrew: `brew list | grep caro`
   - Manual: `ls /usr/local/bin/caro`

2. If installed but not in PATH:
   - macOS/Linux: `export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"`
   - Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc to persist

3. Reload shell:
   - `source ~/.zshrc` (or ~/.bashrc)

4. Verify:
   - `caro --version`

Still stuck? Share your OS: `uname -a`
```

---

### Issue 2: "Generated command doesn't work"

**Root Cause**: Platform mismatch (BSD vs GNU) or inaccurate generation

**Solution**:
```
1. Check your platform: `uname -s`
   - Darwin = macOS (BSD)
   - Linux = Linux (GNU)

2. Is the command using GNU flags on macOS (or vice versa)?
   - macOS issue: Look for `--sort`, `--color=auto` (GNU-only)
   - Linux issue: Look for `-n` on `sort` without `-k` (BSD-only)

3. Test manually:
   - Copy command, run it
   - What's the error message?

4. Report to us:
   - Your query: "[natural language]"
   - Generated: "[command]"
   - Platform: `uname -a`
   - Expected: "[what you wanted]"

We'll investigate and improve accuracy!
```

---

### Issue 3: "Installation fails on Linux"

**Root Cause**: Missing dependencies (curl) or permission issues

**Solution**:
```
1. Check for curl:
   - `which curl`
   - If missing: `sudo apt install curl` (Ubuntu/Debian)

2. Try manual installation:
   - Download: `curl -LO https://github.com/[org]/caro/releases/download/v1.1.0-beta/caro-v1.1.0-beta-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
   - Extract: `tar -xzf caro-*.tar.gz`
   - Move: `sudo mv caro /usr/local/bin/`
   - Verify: `caro --version`

3. Permission issues:
   - Use `sudo` for moving to /usr/local/bin
   - Or install to user directory: `mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && mv caro ~/.local/bin/`

Still stuck? Share your distro: `cat /etc/os-release`
```

---

### Issue 4: "Dangerous command not blocked"

**Root Cause**: Safety pattern missing (critical bug)

**Solution**:
```
⚠️ CRITICAL: This is a P0 bug. Thank you for reporting!

Immediate action:
1. DO NOT run the command
2. Share details:
   - Your query: "[natural language]"
   - Generated command: "[dangerous command]"
   - Why it's dangerous: "[explanation]"

We'll:
1. Add safety pattern immediately (hotfix within 4 hours)
2. Credit you in release notes
3. Notify all users (Discord, Twitter, GitHub)

Your report prevents others from harm—thank you! 🙏
```

---

### Issue 5: "Telemetry privacy concern"

**Root Cause**: User doesn't understand zero-PII guarantee

**Solution**:
```
Great question! Let me clarify our privacy guarantees:

**What we NEVER collect** (even with telemetry enabled):
- Email addresses
- File paths
- IP addresses
- Environment variables
- API keys
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

**What we DO collect** (opt-in only):
- Command category (e.g., "file_management")
- Success/failure (no command content)
- Platform (e.g., "darwin")
- Timestamp

**How to verify**:
1. Enable telemetry: `caro config telemetry --enable`
2. Use Caro (10+ commands)
3. Export data: `caro telemetry export my-data.json`
4. Inspect JSON—you'll see ZERO PII

If you find ANY PII, that's a critical bug. Report immediately.

Our code is open source—audit it yourself: [link]

Does this address your concern?
```

- **Symptoms**: What user sees/experiences
- **Cause**: Why it happens (brief)
- **Solution**: Step-by-step fix
- **Prevention**: How to avoid in future (if applicable)

**Example Article**:
```markdown
## Fix: "Caro: command not found" on macOS

### Symptoms
- Running `caro` returns "command not found"
- Caro was installed via Homebrew
- `brew list` shows caro is installed

### Cause
Homebrew binaries are not in your PATH.

### Solution
1. Add Homebrew to PATH:
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. Reload shell:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. Verify:
   ```bash
   caro --version
   ```

### Prevention
Homebrew installation usually handles PATH automatically. If you installed
Homebrew in a non-standard location, this issue can occur.
```
