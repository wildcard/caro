# Technical Debt Management & Code Health

**Release**: v1.1.0-beta
**Created**: 2026-01-08
**Owner**: Engineering Lead
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-08

---

## Purpose

This document defines the strategy for managing technical debt and maintaining code health throughout the v1.1.0-beta release lifecycle, balancing speed-to-market with long-term maintainability and preventing debt accumulation that could slow future development.

---

## Audience

- **Primary**: Engineering Lead, Engineers
- **Secondary**: Release Manager, Contributors
- **Tertiary**: Future maintainers

---

## Technical Debt Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Acknowledge Debt**: Make conscious decisions, document tradeoffs
2. **Strategic Debt**: Some debt is acceptable to ship faster (with plan to repay)
3. **Track Everything**: Maintain debt inventory, prioritize paydown
4. **Continuous Paydown**: Allocate time every sprint for debt reduction
5. **Prevention > Cure**: Avoid creating new debt when possible

### Types of Technical Debt

**Intentional Debt** (Conscious tradeoffs):
- Quick fixes to meet deadlines (marked with TODO/FIXME)
- Simplified implementations (with plan to improve)
- Skipped optimizations (good enough for now)
- Delayed refactoring (code works, but messy)

**Unintentional Debt** (Accumulated over time):
- Outdated dependencies
- Deprecated APIs
- Inconsistent patterns
- Missing tests
- Poor documentation

**Unavoidable Debt** (External factors):
- Breaking changes in dependencies
- Platform changes (OS updates, new Rust versions)
- Security vulnerabilities requiring urgent patches
- Architecture limitations discovered later

## Section 1: Pre-Release Debt Assessment

### Current Technical Debt Inventory (T-7)

**Major Debt Items** (Known before release):

```markdown
## Category: Performance

### TD-001: LLM Inference Optimization
- **Description**: Embedded backend uses F16 model, could be 2x faster with Q8 quantization
- **Impact**: Medium (affects 32% of queries via LLM fallback)
- **Effort**: High (requires re-training or converting models)
- **Priority**: P2 (nice-to-have for v1.2.0)
- **Tracking**: Issue #156

### TD-002: Static Matcher Coverage
- **Description**: Only 4 static patterns for website examples, need 50+ for 75% coverage
- **Impact**: High (affects response time for 68% of queries)
- **Effort**: Medium (pattern identification + implementation)
- **Priority**: P1 (critical for quality)
- **Tracking**: Issue #159

## Category: Code Quality

### TD-003: Safety Pattern Tests
- **Description**: Some safety patterns lack comprehensive regression tests
- **Impact**: Critical (potential safety validation gaps)
- **Effort**: Medium (write 20-30 additional tests)
- **Priority**: P0 (must complete before beta)
- **Tracking**: Issue #142

### TD-004: Error Message Consistency
- **Description**: Error messages use different formats, some lack actionable guidance
- **Impact**: Low (UX issue, not functional)
- **Effort**: Low (standardize format, improve messages)
- **Priority**: P2 (improvement for v1.1.1)
- **Tracking**: Issue #167

## Category: Architecture

### TD-005: Prompt Builder Duplication
- **Description**: Each backend has its own prompt builder with duplicated logic
- **Impact**: Medium (harder to maintain, inconsistent prompts)
- **Effort**: High (refactor to shared prompt builder)
- **Priority**: P3 (refactor in v1.2.0)
- **Tracking**: Issue #171

### TD-006: Configuration System
- **Description**: Config uses TOML + env vars + CLI args with unclear priority
- **Impact**: Medium (confusing for users, hard to debug)
- **Effort**: Medium (document priority, add validation)
- **Priority**: P2 (clarify in v1.1.1)
- **Tracking**: Issue #178
```

**Debt Metrics**:
- Total debt items: 23 (6 shown above as examples)
- P0 (must fix before release): 2
- P1 (fix in Week 1-2): 5
- P2 (fix in v1.2.0): 10
- P3 (fix in v1.3.0+): 6

---

### Debt Acceptance Criteria

**Pre-Release Gate**:
- [ ] Zero P0 debt items remain
- [ ] All P0 debt either fixed or explicitly accepted with mitigation
- [ ] P1 debt documented with paydown plan
- [ ] New debt during final sprint is marked and tracked

**Acceptance Decision Framework**:

```
For each debt item:
1. Can we ship without fixing this? (Safety, privacy, security must be fixed)
2. What's the user impact if unfixed? (High impact = must fix)
3. Can we mitigate the risk? (Workarounds, documentation, warnings)
4. When will we fix it? (Specific version/date)
5. Who owns the paydown? (Assign owner)

If all questions answered satisfactorily → ACCEPT debt, document, track
If any question has unacceptable answer → BLOCK release, fix now
```

---

## Section 2: Debt During Release (Week 1-4)

### Debt Creation Rules

**When Creating Debt is Acceptable**:
- Hotfix for P0 bug (quality fix now, clean up later)
- Quick workaround for discovered issue (with plan to address root cause)
- Performance optimization deferred (works, just not optimal)
- Refactoring postponed (code messy but functional)

**When Creating Debt is NOT Acceptable**:
- Safety validation shortcuts (NEVER acceptable)
- Privacy violations (NEVER acceptable)
- Security vulnerabilities (NEVER acceptable)
- User-facing bugs (fix properly, not bandaid)
- Breaking changes without migration path

---

### Debt Documentation Standards

**Required Documentation** (for all intentional debt):

```rust
// TD-XXX: Brief description
// Priority: P1/P2/P3
// Impact: Critical/High/Medium/Low
// Effort: High/Medium/Low
// Deadline: v1.X.X or Q1 2026
// Owner: @username
// Tracking: Issue #XXX
// TODO: Specific action needed
//
// Context: Why this debt was created
// Mitigation: Any temporary workarounds in place
// Paydown Plan: How we'll fix this

// Example:
// TD-007: Simplified command validation for launch
// Priority: P1
// Impact: Medium (could miss some edge cases)
// Effort: Medium (2-3 days to implement comprehensive validation)
// Deadline: v1.1.2 (end of Week 2)
// Owner: @alice
// Tracking: Issue #184
// TODO: Implement regex-based validation for all command types
//
// Context: Needed to ship on time, using simple substring matching for now
// Mitigation: Extensive testing of common cases, safety validation still robust
// Paydown Plan: Week 2 sprint - design comprehensive validation, implement, test

fn validate_command_simple(cmd: &str) -> bool {
    // Temporary simple validation
    !cmd.is_empty() && cmd.len() < 1000
}
```

**Code Markers**:
- `// TODO(TD-XXX):` for planned improvements
- `// FIXME(TD-XXX):` for known issues
- `// HACK(TD-XXX):` for temporary workarounds
- `// DEBT(TD-XXX):` for general tech debt

## Section 3: Debt Paydown Strategy

### Allocation Strategy

**Time Allocation**:
- Week 1 (Stabilization): 10% of engineering time for debt paydown
- Week 2-4: 20% of engineering time for debt paydown
- Steady State: 25% of engineering time for debt paydown (1 day per week)

**Prioritization**:
1. **P0 Debt**: Fix immediately (blocks release or critical functionality)
2. **P1 Debt**: Fix within 2 weeks (high impact, manageable effort)
3. **P2 Debt**: Fix within 3 months (medium impact)
4. **P3 Debt**: Fix opportunistically (low impact, large effort)

**Debt Paydown Cadence**:
- Daily: P0 debt (as discovered)
- Weekly: P1 debt (1-2 items per week)
- Monthly: P2 debt (3-5 items per month)
- Quarterly: P3 debt (major refactorings)

---

### Debt Reduction Techniques

**1. Boy Scout Rule**: Leave code better than you found it
```rust
// Before (technical debt):
fn parse_json(s: &str) -> String {
    s.to_string() // Just returns input, no parsing!
}

// After (debt paydown while working nearby):
fn parse_json(s: &str) -> Result<Value, Error> {
    serde_json::from_str(s)
}
```

**2. Incremental Refactoring**: Small improvements over time
```rust
// Week 1: Add types
fn generate(query: &str) -> String { ... }
// Week 2: Add error handling
fn generate(query: &str) -> Result<String, Error> { ... }
// Week 3: Add validation
fn generate(query: &Query) -> Result<Command, Error> { ... }
```

**3. Strangler Fig Pattern**: Gradually replace old code
```rust
// Old system (technical debt)
fn old_command_generator(query: &str) -> String { ... }

// New system (being built)
fn new_command_generator(query: &Query) -> Result<Command, Error> { ... }

// Router (gradually migrate)
fn generate_command(query: &str) -> Result<String, Error> {
    if should_use_new_system(query) {
        new_command_generator(&parse_query(query)?)
            .map(|cmd| cmd.to_string())
    } else {
        Ok(old_command_generator(query))
    }
}
```

**4. Debt Days**: Dedicated time for paydown
- Once per month: Full team "Debt Day"
- Focus on P2/P3 debt that requires coordination
- Celebrate debt reduction (e.g., "Closed 10 debt items!")

---

- P1 fixes: 4 hours
- Features: 24 hours
- Refactorings: 48 hours

---

### Documentation Standards

**Required Documentation**:

1. **Public API**: Rustdoc comments for all public items
```rust
/// Generates a shell command from a natural language query.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `query` - The user's natural language query (e.g., "list files")
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `Result` containing the generated command or an error.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let cmd = generate_command("list files")?;
/// assert_eq!(cmd, "ls -la");
/// ```
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns `Err` if:
/// - Query is empty or invalid
/// - Backend fails to generate command
/// - Safety validation blocks the command
pub fn generate_command(query: &str) -> Result<String, Error> {
    // Implementation
}
```

2. **Complex Logic**: Inline comments explaining "why"
```rust
// Use BSD-style flags on macOS (GNU flags not available)
if cfg!(target_os = "macos") {
    format!("ps aux | sort -k4 -rn") // Sort by memory (column 4), reverse numeric
} else {
    format!("ps aux --sort=-%mem") // GNU-style sort flag
}
```

3. **Architecture**: High-level design docs in `/docs`
- `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Overall system design
- `/docs/SAFETY.md`: Safety validation design
- `/docs/BACKENDS.md`: Backend architecture

---

## Section 5: Dependency Management

### Dependency Health

**Current Dependencies** (Cargo.toml):
```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = "1.35"           # Async runtime
serde = "1.0"            # Serialization
serde_json = "1.0"       # JSON parsing
clap = "4.4"             # CLI parsing
candle-core = "0.3"      # ML inference (embedded backend)
mlx-sys = "0.1"          # MLX bindings (Apple Silicon)
ollama-rs = "0.2"        # Ollama client
anthropic-rs = "0.1"     # Anthropic API client
```

**Dependency Audit**:
```bash
# Check for security vulnerabilities
cargo audit

# Check for outdated dependencies
cargo outdated

# Check for unused dependencies
cargo udeps
```

**Dependency Update Policy**:
- Security updates: Immediate (within 24 hours)
- Major updates: Quarterly (with thorough testing)
- Minor updates: Monthly (low-risk improvements)
- Patch updates: Biweekly (bug fixes)

---

### Dependency Constraints

**Maximum Dependencies**: 50 direct dependencies
- **Rationale**: Each dependency is a maintenance burden and potential vulnerability
- **Current**: 23 direct dependencies (well under limit)

**Allowed Licenses**:
- MIT
- Apache-2.0
- BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause
- ISC
- Unlicense

**Forbidden Licenses**:
- GPL (copyleft incompatible with MIT)
- AGPL (copyleft)
- Proprietary licenses

**License Compliance**:
```bash
# Check all dependency licenses
cargo deny check licenses

# Generate attribution file
cargo about generate about.hbs > ATTRIBUTION.md
```

---

### Dependency Versioning Strategy

**Semantic Versioning**:
- Use `~` for patch updates: `tokio = "~1.35"` (1.35.x)
- Use `^` for minor updates: `serde = "^1.0"` (1.x.x)
- Pin major versions for stability

**Lock File**:
- `Cargo.lock` committed to repo
- Ensures reproducible builds
- Updated deliberately, not automatically

---

## Section 6: Refactoring Strategy

### When to Refactor

**Good Reasons**:
- Code is duplicated (DRY principle violated)
- Code is confusing (readability issue)
- Code is slow (performance issue)
- Code is hard to test (design issue)
- Code violates patterns (inconsistency)

**Bad Reasons**:
- "I don't like the style" (subjective)
- "It could be more clever" (clever is bad)
- "Let me try a new pattern" (consistency matters)
- "Perfection" (good enough is okay)

---

### Refactoring Checklist

**Before Refactoring**:
- [ ] Tests exist for the code (write if missing)
- [ ] Tests pass (baseline)
- [ ] Refactoring is worth the risk (high value)
- [ ] Have time to do it properly (not rushed)

**During Refactoring**:
- [ ] Small, incremental changes
- [ ] Run tests after each change
- [ ] Commit frequently
- [ ] Don't mix refactoring with features

**After Refactoring**:
- [ ] All tests still pass
- [ ] No new warnings
- [ ] Performance not degraded (benchmark)
- [ ] Documentation updated

---

### Safe Refactoring Techniques

**1. Extract Function**:
```rust
// Before: Long function
fn generate_command(query: &str) -> Result<String, Error> {
    // 50 lines of code...
}

// After: Extracted helpers
fn generate_command(query: &str) -> Result<String, Error> {
    let intent = classify_intent(query)?;
    let platform = detect_platform();
    let cmd = match_pattern(intent, platform)?;
    validate_safety(cmd)
}
```

**2. Extract Struct**:
```rust
// Before: Many parameters
fn generate(query: &str, platform: Platform, backend: Backend, config: Config) -> Result<String, Error> { ... }

// After: Struct with builder
struct CommandGenerator {
    platform: Platform,
    backend: Backend,
    config: Config,
}

impl CommandGenerator {
    fn generate(&self, query: &str) -> Result<String, Error> { ... }
}
```

**3. Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**:
```rust
// Before: Big match statement
fn generate(backend: BackendType, query: &str) -> Result<String, Error> {
    match backend {
        BackendType::Static => { /* 20 lines */ },
        BackendType::Embedded => { /* 30 lines */ },
        BackendType::Ollama => { /* 25 lines */ },
    }
}

// After: Trait-based polymorphism
trait Backend {
    fn generate(&self, query: &str) -> Result<String, Error>;
}

struct StaticBackend;
impl Backend for StaticBackend { ... }

struct EmbeddedBackend;
impl Backend for EmbeddedBackend { ... }
```

---

## Section 7: Performance Debt

### Performance Monitoring

**Benchmarks**:
```bash
# Run performance benchmarks
cargo bench

# Profile with flamegraph
cargo flamegraph --bench command_generation

# Memory profiling
valgrind --tool=massif ./target/release/caro "list files"
```

**Performance Targets**:
- Simple queries: <100ms p95
- Medium queries: <500ms p95
- Complex queries: <1000ms p95
- Memory usage: <50MB
- Binary size: <50MB

**Performance Debt Items**:
```markdown
## PD-001: LLM Model Size
- Current: 135M parameter model (small but slow)
- Target: Quantized 360M model (larger but faster with Q8)
- Impact: 2x faster inference
- Effort: High (model conversion + testing)
- Deadline: v1.2.0

## PD-002: JSON Parsing
- Current: Parse JSON string → serde_json
- Target: Streaming JSON parser
- Impact: 10% faster for LLM responses
- Effort: Low (use simd-json crate)
- Deadline: v1.1.3

## PD-003: Static Matcher Lookup
- Current: Linear search through patterns
- Target: Trie or hash map
- Impact: 5x faster for 100+ patterns
- Effort: Medium (data structure change)
- Deadline: v1.2.0
```

---

### Performance Optimization Process

1. **Measure**: Profile to find bottlenecks
2. **Prioritize**: Focus on hot paths (80/20 rule)
3. **Optimize**: Implement improvement
4. **Measure Again**: Verify improvement
5. **Repeat**: Iterate until targets met

**Premature Optimization**: Avoid optimizing before profiling. "Make it work, then make it fast."

---

## Section 8: Testing Debt

### Test Coverage Gaps

**Areas Needing Tests**:
```markdown
## Safety Validation (Critical - 100% coverage required)
- [x] All 100+ dangerous patterns have tests
- [x] Edge cases for each pattern tested
- [ ] Fuzzing for unexpected inputs (TD-020, P1)

## Platform Detection
- [x] macOS detection works
- [x] Linux detection works
- [ ] BSD variants tested (TD-021, P2)
- [ ] Windows detection (future platform, TD-022, P3)

## Error Handling
- [x] Network errors handled
- [x] Parsing errors handled
- [ ] Disk full error handling (TD-023, P2)
- [ ] Out of memory handling (TD-024, P3)

## Integration Tests
- [x] Static → Embedded fallback
- [x] Command validation pipeline
- [ ] Configuration priority (TD-025, P1)
- [ ] Telemetry opt-in flow (TD-026, P1)
```

---

### Test Quality Improvements

## Section 10: Debt Prevention

### Pre-Commit Checks

**.git/hooks/pre-commit**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Running pre-commit checks..."

# 1. Format check
cargo fmt -- --check || {
    echo "❌ Code not formatted. Run: cargo fmt"
    exit 1
}

# 2. Lint check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings || {
    echo "❌ Clippy warnings found. Fix them."
    exit 1
}

# 3. Unit tests
cargo test --lib || {
    echo "❌ Unit tests failed."
    exit 1
}

# 4. Check for TODO without tracking
git diff --cached | grep -i "TODO" | grep -v "TD-" && {
    echo "⚠️  Found TODO without tracking ID. Use TODO(TD-XXX) format."
    exit 1
}

echo "✅ All pre-commit checks passed!"
```

---

### Code Review Culture

**Review Goals**:
- Catch bugs early
- Share knowledge
- Maintain quality standards
- Prevent debt accumulation

**Review Guidelines**:
- Be kind and constructive
- Focus on code, not person

**End of Technical Debt Management Plan**

This plan ensures balanced management of technical debt throughout the v1.1.0-beta release lifecycle, maintaining code health while shipping quickly and preventing debt accumulation that could slow future development.

**Remember**: Some debt is acceptable to ship faster, but we must acknowledge it, track it, and pay it down systematically. The goal is sustainable velocity, not perfection.
