# v1.1.0 User Feedback & Iteration Strategy

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-08
**Owner**: Product Lead + Community Manager
**Status**: Active

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines how we collect, analyze, and act on user feedback during and after the v1.1.0-beta launch. It provides a systematic approach to continuous improvement driven by real user needs and pain points.

**Feedback Philosophy**: **Listen, Learn, Iterate** - Build what users need, not what we think they need.

**Key Channels**:
- Discord (primary community hub)
- GitHub Issues & Discussions
- In-app feedback (`caro feedback`)
- Social media (Twitter, Reddit)
- Telemetry data (opt-in, aggregated)

**Iteration Cadence**: Weekly prioritization, bi-weekly releases (hotfixes as needed)

---

### 4. In-App Feedback

**Implementation** (future: v1.2.0):
```bash
# Quick feedback command
$ caro feedback "Validation retry is awesome!"
✅ Thank you! Your feedback helps us improve caro.

# Bug report with auto-diagnostics
$ caro report-bug
📋 Collecting diagnostic information...
   - caro version: 1.1.0-beta
   - OS: macOS 14.0 (ARM64)
   - Last 10 commands (redacted)
   - Error logs (last 24h)

📝 Describe the bug:
> [User types description]

✅ Bug report created: #123
   View at: https://github.com/user/caro/issues/123
```

**Benefits**:
- Lower friction (no need to open browser)
- Auto-includes diagnostic info
- Structured data collection

---

### 5. Social Media

**Twitter/X Monitoring**:
- Search: `"caro" AND ("bug" OR "error" OR "issue")`
- Monitor: Mentions, DMs, quote tweets
- Respond: <2 hours

**Reddit Monitoring**:
- r/rust, r/commandline, r/devops
- Weekly check for caro mentions
- Respond to questions, collect feedback

**Hacker News**:
- Monitor comments on launch post
- Engage thoughtfully (no defensiveness)
- Extract actionable feedback

---

### 6. Telemetry Data (Opt-In)

**Aggregate Metrics**:
```sql
-- Most common error types
SELECT error_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM telemetry_errors
WHERE timestamp >= datetime('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY error_type
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Backend usage distribution
SELECT backend, COUNT(*) as queries
FROM telemetry_queries
WHERE timestamp >= datetime('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY backend;

-- Query categories with low success rates
SELECT category, AVG(success) as success_rate
FROM telemetry_queries
WHERE timestamp >= datetime('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY category
HAVING success_rate < 0.8
ORDER BY success_rate ASC;
```

**Best For**:
- Identifying common failure patterns
- Understanding feature usage
- Quantifying user pain points

**Privacy**: Only aggregated, anonymized data analyzed

---

## Feedback Classification

### Bug Severity

| Severity | Definition | Example | Response Time |
|----------|------------|---------|---------------|
| **P0 (Critical)** | Blocks all users, data loss, security | Crash on startup | <1 hour |
| **P1 (High)** | Blocks major workflows | Static matcher broken | <24 hours |
| **P2 (Medium)** | Annoying but has workaround | Slow performance | <7 days |
| **P3 (Low)** | Minor inconvenience | Typo in help text | Next release |

**Auto-Triage Rules**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/issue-triage.yml
- label: "P0"
  conditions:
    - title_contains: ["crash", "data loss", "security"]
    - notify: "@security-team"

- label: "P1"
  conditions:
    - title_contains: ["broken", "not working", "fails"]
    - notify: "@eng-team"
```

---

### Feature Priority

**RICE Scoring Framework**:

**R**each: How many users affected? (1-10)
**I**mpact: How much improvement? (1-10)
**C**onfidence: How sure are we? (1-10)
**E**ffort: How much work? (1-10, inverse)

**Formula**: `Priority = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort`

**Example**:
```
Feature: Docker command patterns
- Reach: 7/10 (many DevOps users)
- Impact: 8/10 (major workflow improvement)
- Confidence: 9/10 (clear user demand)
- Effort: 5/10 (moderate implementation)

Priority = (7 × 8 × 9) / 5 = 100.8
```

**Prioritization Tiers**:
- **P0**: Score >100 (must-have for next release)
- **P1**: Score 50-100 (nice-to-have for next release)
- **P2**: Score <50 (backlog for future)

---

### Feedback Types

| Type | Label | Example | Action |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Bug** | 🐛 bug | Command fails on Linux | Fix ASAP |
| **Feature Request** | ✨ enhancement | Add Git commands | Prioritize via RICE |
| **Documentation** | 📚 docs | Unclear installation guide | Update docs |
| **Question** | ❓ question | How do I use --force? | Answer + update FAQ |
| **Performance** | ⚡ performance | Slow on large directories | Profile & optimize |
| **UX** | 🎨 ux | Confusing error messages | Improve messaging |

### Feedback Analysis Tools

**Sentiment Analysis** (manual or automated):
```python
# Example: Analyze Discord messages
import discord
from textblob import TextBlob

def analyze_sentiment(messages):
    sentiments = []
    for msg in messages:
        polarity = TextBlob(msg.content).sentiment.polarity
        sentiments.append(polarity)

    avg_sentiment = sum(sentiments) / len(sentiments)

    if avg_sentiment > 0.2:
        return "😊 Positive"
    elif avg_sentiment < -0.2:
        return "😞 Negative"
    else:
        return "😐 Neutral"
```

**Issue Clustering**:
- Group similar bug reports (e.g., all "macOS ARM crashes")
- Identify common themes (e.g., "validation too strict")
- Prioritize systemic issues over one-offs

---

### User Segmentation

**Power Users** (Top 10% by usage):
- More feature requests
- Higher tolerance for complexity
- Valuable for beta testing

**Casual Users** (Bottom 50%):
- Focus on ease of use
- Need better onboarding
- UX improvements benefit them most

**Churned Users** (Stopped using):
- Reach out for exit interviews
- Understand what didn't work
- Win-back opportunities

## Iteration Planning

### Release Cadence

**v1.1.x Hotfixes**: As needed (critical bugs)
**v1.2.x Minor Releases**: Every 4-6 weeks
**v2.0.x Major Releases**: Every 6-12 months

**Release Decision Tree**:
```
New feedback collected
       ↓
   Is it a bug?
   ├─ P0? → Hotfix (v1.1.x) within 24h
   ├─ P1? → Hotfix (v1.1.x) within 7 days
   └─ P2/P3? → Next minor (v1.2.x)
       ↓
   Is it a feature?
   ├─ RICE >100? → Next minor (v1.2.x)
   ├─ RICE 50-100? → Maybe next minor
   └─ RICE <50? → Backlog (v2.x or later)
```
