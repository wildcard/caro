## Interactive Examples

### Example Session 1: Safe File Cleanup

```bash
$ caro "find and delete all .tmp files older than 7 days"

Generated command:
  find . -name "*.tmp" -type f -mtime +7 -delete

Safety Assessment: 🟠 High (Orange)
- Performs deletion (irreversible)
- Recursive operation
- Affects multiple files

⚠️ RECOMMENDATION: Preview files first:
  find . -name "*.tmp" -type f -mtime +7 -ls

Preview files? (y/N) y
[Shows list of files that would be deleted]

Proceed with deletion? (y/N) y
[Deletes files]
```

### Example Session 2: System Monitoring

```bash
$ caro "watch disk space every 5 seconds"

Generated command:
  watch -n 5 df -h

Safety Assessment: ✅ Safe (Green)
- Read-only operation
- No system modifications

Execute this command? (y/N) y
[Runs watch command, Ctrl+C to exit]
```

### Example Session 3: Log Analysis

```bash
$ caro "show the 20 most common error messages in application.log"

Generated command:
  grep -i error application.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20

Safety Assessment: ✅ Safe (Green)
- Read-only operation
- Standard text processing

Explanation:
1. grep -i error application.log    : Find lines with 'error' (case-insensitive)
2. sort                              : Sort error messages
3. uniq -c                           : Count unique occurrences
4. sort -rn                          : Sort by count (highest first)
5. head -20                          : Show top 20

Execute this command? (y/N) y
```

## Configuration Examples

### Custom Safety Level

```bash
# Edit config
vim ~/.config/Caro/config.toml
```

```toml
[safety]
enabled = true
level = "moderate"  # strict, moderate, or permissive
require_confirmation = true
```

### Backend Selection

```toml
[backend]
primary = "embedded"  # embedded, ollama, or vllm
enable_fallback = true

[backend.ollama]
base_url = "http://localhost:11434"
model_name = "codellama:7b"
```

### Output Format

```bash
# JSON output (for scripting)
$ caro --output json "list all files"
{
  "command": "ls -lah",
  "safety_level": "safe",
  "explanation": "List files with details"
}

# YAML output
$ caro --output yaml "find large files"
command: "find . -type f -size +100M"
safety_level: "safe"
explanation: "Find files larger than 100MB"
```

## Tips for Better Results

### 1. Be Specific

```bash
# ✗ Vague
$ caro "find files"

# ✓ Specific
$ caro "find all JavaScript files modified in the last week in the src/ directory"
```

### 2. Include Safety Context

```bash
# ✗ No context
$ caro "delete log files"

# ✓ With safety context
$ caro "safely delete log files older than 30 days, with preview first"
```

### 3. Mention Output Requirements

```bash
# ✗ Unclear format
$ caro "show processes"

# ✓ Specific format
$ caro "show processes sorted by memory usage, with headers, human-readable sizes"
```

### 4. Request Explanations

```bash
# ✗ Just the command
$ caro "complicated operation"

# ✓ With explanation
$ caro "explain how to recursively find and compress all log files older than a month"
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

When Caro prompts for confirmation:
- `y` or `yes` - Execute the command
- `n` or `no` - Cancel
- `e` or `explain` - Show detailed explanation
- `s` or `safer` - Suggest a safer alternative

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Safe Deletion

1. Generate command: `caro "delete old logs"`
2. Review safety assessment
3. Preview files: `caro "show me which log files would be deleted"`
4. Confirm scope is correct
5. Execute deletion with confirmation

### Workflow 2: Data Transformation

1. Test on sample: `caro "convert first 10 lines of data.csv to JSON"`
2. Verify output format
3. Run on full dataset: `caro "convert entire data.csv to JSON"`
4. Save output: `caro "convert data.csv to JSON and save as data.json"`

### Workflow 3: System Administration

1. Check current state: `caro "show current disk usage"`
2. Plan action: `caro "what's the safe way to clean up /var/log"`
3. Preview impact: `caro "show which logs would be deleted"`
4. Execute with confirmation
5. Verify result: `caro "show disk usage again"`

## Error Handling

### Command Not Found

```bash
$ caro "use imaginary-tool to process data"

Error: Command 'imaginary-tool' not found on this system

Suggestion: Try one of these standard tools instead:
- awk: Text processing
- sed: Stream editing
- grep: Pattern matching

Reformulate your request? (y/N)
```

### Ambiguous Request

```bash
$ caro "find files"

Generated command:
  find .

Note: This will list ALL files recursively. Did you mean:
1. find . -name "*.txt"           # Find specific file type
2. find . -type f -mtime -1       # Find recent files
3. find . -maxdepth 1             # Find in current directory only

Select option (1-3) or press Enter to use generated command:
```

### Safety Violation

```bash
$ caro "delete everything in root directory"

🔴 CRITICAL SAFETY VIOLATION

This command would:
  rm -rf /

Risk: Complete system destruction

❌ This operation is blocked for safety.

Did you mean one of these instead?
- Delete files in current directory: rm -rf ./*
- Delete specific folder: rm -rf ./folder-name
- Clean temporary files: rm -rf /tmp/my-temp-files

Try again with a safer request.
```

## Advanced Usage

### Chaining Commands

```bash
$ caro "find all large files, compress them, and move to archive/"
Generated: find . -type f -size +100M -exec gzip {} \; -exec mv {}.gz archive/ \;

# Or as separate steps
$ caro "first step: find large files"
$ caro "second step: compress the files I found"
$ caro "third step: move compressed files to archive/"
```

### Custom Patterns

Add to `~/.config/Caro/config.toml`:

```toml
[aliases]
"cleanup logs" = "find /var/log -name '*.log' -mtime +30 -delete"
"backup home" = "tar czf ~/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz ~"
```

Then:
```bash
$ caro "cleanup logs"
# Uses your custom pattern
```

## Getting Help

```bash
# Show help
caro --help

# Show current configuration
caro --show-config

# Verbose mode (for debugging)
caro --verbose "your command description"

# Check backend status
