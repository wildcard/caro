## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Location Pre-flight Check (CRITICAL for AI Agents)

**BEFORE PROCEEDING:** Verify you are working from inside the feature worktree.

**Check current working directory and branch:**
```bash
pwd
git branch --show-current
```

**Expected output:**
- `pwd`: `/path/to/project/.worktrees/004-feature-name` (or similar)
- Branch: `004-feature-name` (NOT `main` or `release/x.x.x`)

**If you see `main` or `release/*` branch, OR if pwd shows the main repo:**

⛔ **STOP - You are in the wrong location!**

**DO NOT use `cd` to navigate to the worktree.** File editing tools (Edit, Write) will still use your original working directory.

**Instead:**
1. Tell the user: "This command must be run from inside the worktree at `.worktrees/<feature>/`"
2. Stop execution
3. Wait for the user to restart the session from the correct location

**Path reference rule:** Always use paths relative to the worktree root (e.g., `kitty-specs/004-feature/tasks/`). When communicating with the user, mention absolute paths for clarity.

This is intentional - worktrees provide isolation for parallel feature development.

## Outline

1. Run `.kittify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --include-tasks` from repo root; capture `FEATURE_DIR`, `AVAILABLE_DOCS`, and `tasks.md` path.

2. Determine the review target:
   - If user input specifies a filename, validate it exists under `tasks/for_review/` (support phase subdirectories).
   - Otherwise, select the oldest file in `tasks/for_review/` (lexical order is sufficient because filenames retain task ordering).
   - Abort with instructional message if no files are waiting for review.

3. Load context for the selected task:
   - Read the prompt file frontmatter (lane MUST be `for_review`); note `task_id`, `phase`, `agent`, `shell_pid`.
   - Read the body sections (Objective, Context, Implementation Guidance, etc.).
   - Consult supporting documents as referenced: constitution, plan, spec, data-model, contracts, research, quickstart, code changes.
   - Review the associated code in the repository (diffs, tests, docs) to validate the implementation.

4. Conduct the review:
   - Verify implementation against the prompt’s Definition of Done and Review Guidance.
   - Run required tests or commands; capture results.
   - Document findings explicitly: bugs, regressions, missing tests, risks, or validation notes.

5. Decide outcome:
  - **Needs changes**:
     * **CRITICAL**: Insert detailed feedback in the `## Review Feedback` section (located immediately after the frontmatter, before Objectives). This is the FIRST thing implementers will see when they re-read the prompt.
     * Use a clear structure:
       ```markdown
       ## Review Feedback

       **Status**: ❌ **Needs Changes**

       **Key Issues**:
       1. [Issue 1] - Why it's a problem and what to do about it
       2. [Issue 2] - Why it's a problem and what to do about it

       **What Was Done Well**:
       - [Positive note 1]
       - [Positive note 2]

       **Action Items** (must complete before re-review):
       - [ ] Fix [specific thing 1]
       - [ ] Add [missing thing 2]
       - [ ] Verify [validation point 3]
       ```
     * Update frontmatter:
       - Set `lane: "planned"`
       - Set `review_status: "has_feedback"`
       - Set `reviewed_by: <YOUR_AGENT_ID>`
       - Clear `assignee` if needed
     * Append a new entry in the prompt's **Activity Log** with timestamp, reviewer agent, shell PID, and summary of feedback.
     * Run `.kittify/scripts/bash/tasks-move-to-lane.sh <FEATURE> <TASK_ID> planned --note "Code review complete: [brief summary of issues]"` (use the PowerShell equivalent on Windows) so the move and history update are staged consistently.
  - **Approved**:
     * **Use the dedicated approval command** to ensure proper reviewer attribution:
       ```bash
       # Capture reviewer identity
       REVIEWER_AGENT=<YOUR_AGENT_ID>  # e.g., "claude-reviewer" or from $AGENT_ID
       REVIEWER_SHELL_PID=$$           # Current shell PID

       # Use tasks-approve command for proper review attribution
       python3 .kittify/scripts/tasks/tasks_cli.py approve <FEATURE> <TASK_ID> \
         --review-status "approved without changes" \
         --reviewer-agent "$REVIEWER_AGENT" \
         --reviewer-shell-pid "$REVIEWER_SHELL_PID"
       ```
     * This automatically:
       - Sets `lane: "done"`
       - Sets `review_status: "approved without changes"` (or your custom status)
       - Sets `reviewed_by: <YOUR_AGENT_ID>`
       - Updates `agent: <YOUR_AGENT_ID>` and `shell_pid: <YOUR_SHELL_PID>`
       - Appends Activity Log entry with reviewer's info (NOT implementer's)
       - Handles git operations (add new location, remove old location)
     * **Alternative:** For custom review statuses, use `--review-status "approved with minor notes"` or `--target-lane "planned"` for rejected tasks.
     * Use helper script to mark the task complete in `tasks.md` (see Step 7).

7. Update `tasks.md` automatically:
   - Run `.kittify/scripts/bash/mark-task-status.sh --task-id <TASK_ID> --status done` (POSIX) or `.kittify/scripts/powershell/Set-TaskStatus.ps1 -TaskId <TASK_ID> -Status done` (PowerShell) from repo root.
   - Confirm the task entry now shows `[X]` and includes a reference to the prompt file in its notes.

7. Produce a review report summarizing:
   - Task ID and filename reviewed.
  - Approval status and key findings.
   - Tests executed and their results.
   - Follow-up actions (if any) for other team members.
   - Reminder to push changes or notify teammates as per project conventions.

Context for review: $ARGUMENTS (resolve this to the prompt's relative path, e.g., `kitty-specs/<feature>/tasks/for_review/WPXX.md`)

All review feedback must live inside the prompt file, ensuring future implementers understand historical decisions before revisiting the task.
