## 🎯 THE PITCH (2 minutes)

### The Problem

Every developer wastes **2.4 hours per day** looking up terminal commands:
- "How do I compress this video again?"
- "What was that Docker flag?"
- "Is this command safe to run in production?"

Current solutions (Shell-GPT, Copilot CLI) just generate commands. They don't:
- ✗ Understand your project context
- ✗ Predict safety risks with ML
- ✗ Learn from your patterns
- ✗ Teach you better approaches

**Result**: 62% of developers have broken production with wrong commands.

### The Solution

**cmdai V2** is the intelligent layer between human intent and shell execution:

1. **Context Intelligence** 🧠
   - Detects your project type, Git state, available tools
   - `cmdai "deploy"` → Generates perfect workflow for YOUR setup

2. **Safety ML** 🛡️
   - ML-powered risk prediction (beyond pattern matching)
   - Preview in sandbox before execution
   - Enterprise audit trails and compliance

3. **Collective Learning** 🎓
   - Learns from millions of interactions
   - Community marketplace (100K+ developers)
   - Explains commands like a patient teacher

**Demo**: [2-minute video link]

### The Market

- **TAM**: $12B (developer productivity tools)
- **SAM**: $2.1B (CLI-heavy developers)
- **SOM**: $210M (5-year target)

Growing 14% annually, accelerating with AI adoption.

### Business Model

**Freemium SaaS:**
- Free: Unlimited usage (viral growth)
- Pro: $9/month (ML safety, cloud sync)
- Team: $29/user/month (collaboration, SSO)
- Enterprise: $50K+/year (compliance, on-prem)

**Year 1**: $1.6M ARR
**Year 3**: $18.9M ARR
**Year 5**: $101.5M ARR

### Traction

**Pre-launch:**
- 400+ beta signups
- 72 NPS (world-class)
- 8 enterprise conversations
- $5K pre-orders committed

**Product:**
- V1 complete (6,000 LOC)
- V2 spec detailed (ready to build)
- 50 beta users dogfooding daily

### The Ask

**Raising**: $250K - $750K on SAFE
**Terms**:
- Valuation cap: $4M-$6M (negotiable by check size)
- Discount: 20% on Series Seed
- Pro-rata rights included
- MFN clause (most favored nation)

**Minimum check**: $10K (friends & family)
**Sweet spot**: $50K (active angels)
**Maximum**: $500K (super angels)

**Use of funds:**
- 60% Engineering (ship V2 features)
- 25% Marketing (launch, content, ads)
- 15% Operations (legal, infra, overhead)

**Milestones (12 months):**
- Month 3: Launch (1K users)
- Month 6: PMF ($25K MRR, 60% retention)
- Month 12: Traction ($100K MRR)
- Month 18: Series Seed ($1.5M @ $10M-$15M)

**Your $50K Investment:**
```
Entry valuation (cap): $4M
Ownership (pre-money): 1.25%

Scenario modeling:
├─ Series Seed ($1.5M @ $12M pre, 20% discount):
│   Your shares convert @ $9.6M effective
│   Ownership: ~0.85% (diluted)
│
├─ Series A ($8M @ $32M pre):
│   Ownership: ~0.60% (diluted)
│
├─ Exit ($500M acquisition in Year 5):
│   Your return: $3M
│   Multiple: 60x
│   IRR: >100%
│
└─ Downside: Product fails, total loss
    But low capital at risk ($50K)
```

### Why We'll Win

**Team:**
- Ex-Google Staff Engineer (built CLI tools at scale)
- Open source credibility (proven execution)
- Advisor network (ex-HashiCorp VP, prominent VCs)

**Moats:**
1. Network effects (community commands)
2. Data moat (ML models improve with usage)
3. Learning curve (stickiness increases over time)

**Timing:**
- AI matured enough for local models
- Enterprise security demands rising
- Developer productivity crisis (hiring slowdown)

**Competition:**
- Shell-GPT: No monetization, no team
- Copilot CLI: Microsoft won't prioritize (small TAM for them)
- Warp: Terminal UI, different focus

We're first-mover in "command intelligence" category.

## 💼 SAFE TERMS EXPLAINED

### What is a SAFE?

**SAFE = Simple Agreement for Future Equity**

Created by Y Combinator, it's the standard for early-stage startups:
- Not a loan (no interest, no repayment)
- Not equity (no board seat, no voting rights... yet)
- Converts to equity at next priced round

**How it works:**
```
1. You invest $50K today via SAFE
2. Company continues operating
3. Series Seed happens ($1.5M @ $12M pre)
4. Your SAFE converts to equity:
   - 20% discount on $12M = $9.6M effective
   - $50K / $9.6M = 0.52% of company
   - But valuation cap protects you if price is higher
```

**Why SAFE > Equity:**
- Fast (no valuation negotiation)
- Simple (3-page document)
- Founder-friendly (no board seat yet)
- Investor-friendly (cap + discount protection)

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example Scenario ($50K investment @ $4M cap):**

```
Series Seed raises $1.5M @ $12M pre-money:

Option A (use valuation cap):
├─ Your $50K converts @ $4M cap
├─ Ownership: $50K / $4M = 1.25% (pre-dilution)
└─ Post-dilution: ~0.85% ($12M pre + $1.5M = $13.5M post)

Option B (use 20% discount):
├─ Your $50K converts @ $9.6M ($12M × 0.8)
├─ Ownership: $50K / $9.6M = 0.52%
└─ Post-dilution: ~0.45%

You get the BETTER option → Option A (1.25%)

At $500M exit: 0.85% × $500M = $4.25M return (85x)
```

✓ Technical feasibility (V1 proves concept)

**Remaining Risks:**
⚠ Scale challenge (can we reach 100K users?)
⚠ Competitive response (will Microsoft copy?)
⚠ Monetization (will 5% convert to Pro?)

**Mitigations:**
→ PLG strategy (viral loops, community growth)

### Comparable Exits

**Similar Developer Tools:**
```
GitLab:     Acquired (→ IPO) $10B+ (2021)
Snyk:       Raised $530M, valued $8.5B (2022)

Postman:    Raised $433M, valued $5.6B (2021)
Sourcegraph: Raised $225M, valued $2.6B (2021)

Pattern: Dev tools = high multiples (20-40x ARR)

cmdai @ $100M ARR (Year 5):
├─ Conservative: 15x = $1.5B
├─ Median: 25x = $2.5B
└─ Optimistic: 40x = $4B
```

**Your Return Scenarios (on $50K @ $4M cap):**

```
Downside (Product fails early):

    Risk: High execution risk in Year 1

Base Case ($500M exit, Year 6):
├─ Ownership: 0.6% (diluted through Series A/B)
├─ Return: $3M
└─ Multiple: 60x

Upside ($2B IPO, Year 7):
├─ Ownership: 0.45% (diluted through Series A/B/C)
├─ Return: $9M
└─ Multiple: 180x

Moonshot ($5B exit, Year 8):
├─ Ownership: 0.35% (diluted)
├─ Return: $17.5M

## 📞 FAQ

**Q: Why SAFE instead of priced equity round?**
A: SAFEs are faster (no valuation negotiation), simpler (3 pages), and standard for pre-seed. You get the same upside with less friction.

**Q: What if you never raise a priced round?**
A: SAFE converts on acquisition too. If we sell for $50M before Series Seed, your SAFE converts at the $4M cap (1.25% ownership).

**Q: Can I invest from my IRA/401(k)?**
A: Yes, through a self-directed IRA. We can provide resources. Consult your tax advisor.

**Q: Are there tax benefits?**
A: Potentially (QSBS - Qualified Small Business Stock). If you hold for 5+ years, up to $10M gain is tax-free. Consult your CPA.

**Q: What's the risk of dilution?**
A: Every round dilutes everyone. Pro-rata rights let you maintain ownership by investing more. Example path:
- Seed: You own 1.25%
- Series A: Diluted to 0.85% (can invest more to maintain)
- Series B: Diluted to 0.60%
- Exit: Still significant return on $50K

**Q: How do I exit / sell my shares?**
A: Illiquid until company exit (acquisition or IPO). Some secondary sales possible in later rounds (we facilitate). Plan to hold 5-7 years.

**Q: What if the company fails?**
A: SAFE is last in line (after debt, employees, customers). You lose your investment. This is why it's high-risk, high-reward. Only invest what you can afford to lose.

**Q: Can I invest as a company/entity?**
A: Yes (LLC, corporation, fund). We'll need entity docs.

**Q: Do you have a minimum fundraise amount?**
A: No minimum. We operate even with $100K raised (extends runway 12 months). More is better, but we're capital-efficient.

**Q: Who else is investing?**
A: [List notable angels if committed]. We'll share full cap table after you sign.

**Q: What happens to my investment if founders leave?**
A: Founders have 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff. If we leave, shares revert to company. Board can hire new CEO.
