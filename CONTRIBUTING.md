## Project Vision

**Guard Rails for the Fast Lane**

cmdai aims to make shell command generation:
- **Safe by default** - Every command validated before execution
- **Blazingly fast** - Sub-100ms startup, sub-2s inference on Apple Silicon
- **Truly local** - No cloud dependencies, your data stays on your machine
- **Developer-friendly** - Single binary, minimal configuration, helpful error messages
- **Community-driven** - Open development, transparent processes, welcoming to all skill levels

We prioritize correctness, safety, and user experience above all else.

**Your terminal. Now with a brain.** We're building the safety validator that every AI terminal tool should have.

## Getting Started

**New to cmdai?** Start with our [Contributor Onboarding Guide](culture/CONTRIBUTOR_ONBOARDING.md) - it's designed to get you from zero to first contribution in 5 minutes.

**Already familiar?** Jump straight into the quick setup below.

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.75 or later** with Cargo
- **Git** for version control
- **cargo-watch** (optional but recommended): `cargo install cargo-watch`
- **macOS with Apple Silicon** (optional, for MLX backend development)

### Quick Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cmdai.git
   cd cmdai
   ```

2. **Ensure Rust environment is loaded**:
   ```bash
   # Verify cargo is available
   which cargo

   # If not found, load Rust environment
   . "$HOME/.cargo/env"
   ```

3. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

4. **Run the test suite**:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

5. **Install recommended tools**:
   ```bash
   cargo install cargo-watch  # Continuous test runner
   cargo install cargo-audit  # Security auditing
   ```

### Verify Your Setup

Run the full validation suite to ensure everything is working:

```bash
# Format check
cargo fmt --check

# Linter
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Tests
cargo test

# Or use the convenience command
make check
```

If all checks pass, you're ready to contribute!

**Ship faster. Sleep better.** Our development tools are designed to catch issues early.

## Development Workflow

cmdai follows strict **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with spec-driven design. See [TDD-WORKFLOW.md](TDD-WORKFLOW.md) for complete details.

### The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

1. **RED**: Write a failing test that expresses desired behavior
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### Continuous Test Feedback

Use cargo-watch for instant feedback during development:

```bash
# Start test watcher
. "$HOME/.cargo/env" && cargo watch -x test

# Check watch status
/bashes

# Run specific test suite
cargo test --test cache_contract
```

### Working with Specifications

Before implementing a feature:

1. **Review the specification** in `specs/[feature-id]/spec.md`
2. **Check API contracts** in `specs/[feature-id]/contracts/`
3. **Review quickstart scenarios** in `specs/[feature-id]/quickstart.md`
4. **Write contract tests** in `tests/contract/` that validate the spec
5. **Implement the feature** using TDD cycles

Example workflow:
```bash
# Review spec for cache module
cat specs/003-implement-core-infrastructure/contracts/cache-api.md

# Write failing contract test
vim tests/cache_contract.rs

# Implement minimal solution
vim src/cache/mod.rs

# Watch tests turn green
# (cargo-watch running in background)

# Refactor for quality
vim src/cache/mod.rs
```

---

## Code Standards

**Quality is a feature.** These standards help us maintain fast, safe, and reliable code.

### Formatting

We use rustfmt with project-specific configuration:

```bash
# Format all code
cargo fmt --all

# Check formatting without changing files
cargo fmt --check
```

**Standards**:
- 4-space indentation (no tabs)
- 100-column line width
- 2021 edition idioms
- Reordered imports

### Linting

All Clippy warnings are treated as errors:

```bash
# Run linter
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

**Key rules**:
- No `allow` attributes without explanation comments
- Minimum 3 enum variants (Clippy threshold)
- Descriptive variable names
- No unnecessary type annotations

### Naming Conventions

Follow Rust standard naming:
- **Types**: `UpperCamelCase` (e.g., `CacheManager`, `BackendConfig`)
- **Functions/modules**: `snake_case` (e.g., `get_model`, `cache::manifest`)
- **Constants**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `DEFAULT_CACHE_DIR`)
- **Lifetimes**: `'a`, `'cache`, `'static`

### Error Handling

**Never panic in production code.** We use `Result` types to provide clear, actionable error messages.

```rust
// Library code - use thiserror
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum CacheError {
    #[error("Failed to download model: {0}")]
    DownloadFailed(String),

    #[error("Model not found: {0}")]
    ModelNotFound(String),

    #[error("I/O error: {0}")]
    IoError(#[from] std::io::Error),
}

// Binary code - use anyhow for context
use anyhow::{Context, Result};

fn load_config() -> Result<Config> {
    Config::load()
        .context("Failed to load configuration from ~/.config/cmdai/config.toml")?
}
```

**Error message guidelines**:
- Be specific and actionable
- Include context (file paths, model IDs, etc.)
- Suggest solutions when possible
- Use `#[from]` for automatic error conversion

### Documentation

All public APIs must have rustdoc comments:

```rust
/// Retrieves a model from cache or downloads it from Hugging Face Hub.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `model_id` - Hugging Face model identifier (e.g., "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct")
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Path to the cached model directory on success.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns `CacheError::ModelNotFound` if the model doesn't exist on HF Hub.
/// Returns `CacheError::DownloadFailed` if network issues prevent download.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let cache = CacheManager::new()?;
/// let model_path = cache.get_model("Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct").await?;
/// ```
pub async fn get_model(&self, model_id: &str) -> Result<PathBuf, CacheError> {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Contract Tests

All modules must have contract tests validating their public API:

```rust
// tests/cache_contract.rs
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_cache_manager_retrieves_model() {
    let cache = CacheManager::new().expect("cache creation failed");
    let result = cache.get_model("test-model").await;
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_cache_manager_handles_missing_model() {
    let cache = CacheManager::new().expect("cache creation failed");
    let result = cache.get_model("nonexistent-model").await;
    assert!(matches!(result, Err(CacheError::ModelNotFound(_))));
}
```

## Spec-Driven Development

cmdai follows a specification-first approach:

### Specification Structure

Each feature has a spec directory under `specs/[feature-id]/`:

```
specs/003-implement-core-infrastructure/
├── spec.md              # Feature requirements and acceptance criteria
├── plan.md              # Implementation plan with phases
├── contracts/           # API contracts for each module
│   ├── cache-api.md
│   ├── config-api.md
│   ├── logging-api.md
│   └── execution-api.md
├── quickstart.md        # User-facing scenarios
├── data-model.md        # Data structures and types
├── research.md          # Background research and decisions
└── tasks.md             # Implementation checklist
```

### Development Flow

1. **Specification phase**: Create or review spec in `specs/[feature-id]/spec.md`
2. **Contract definition**: Define module APIs in `specs/[feature-id]/contracts/`
3. **Test writing**: Create contract tests in `tests/contract/` based on contracts
4. **Implementation**: Use TDD cycles to implement features
5. **Integration**: Write integration tests for cross-module workflows
6. **Documentation**: Update quickstart guides and API docs

### Example: Adding a New Backend

```bash
# 1. Review backend specification
cat specs/[backend-id]/spec.md

# 2. Review CommandGenerator trait contract
cat specs/[backend-id]/contracts/backend-api.md

# 3. Write failing contract test
cat > tests/contract/vllm_contract.rs <<EOF
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_vllm_backend_implements_command_generator() {
    let backend = VllmBackend::new(config);
    let request = CommandRequest::new("list files");
    let result = backend.generate_command(&request).await;
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}
EOF

# 4. Implement backend with TDD
vim src/backends/vllm.rs

# 5. Watch tests turn green
# (cargo-watch running in background)
```
