## Your First Contribution: A Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your Adventure

Pick an issue that excites you! We've created **10 fabulous first-time issues** tagged with:
- `good-first-issue` - Perfect for beginners
- `first-time-contributor` - We'll hold your hand through the process
- Category tags like `safety`, `documentation`, `testing`, `ui`, `agent`, etc.

**Can't find an issue that fits?** Open a new one! Describe what you'd like to work on, and we'll help you scope it.

### Step 2: Claim Your Issue

1. Comment on the issue: "I'd like to work on this!"
2. Tell us a bit about yourself (optional but fun!)
3. Ask any questions you have
4. Wait for assignment (usually < 24 hours)

### Step 3: Set Up Your Development Environment

Follow our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) setup guide. If you get stuck:
- **Don't panic!** Everyone gets stuck.
- **Ask for help** in the issue comments or discussions
- **Share your error messages** (we can't debug telepathically... yet)

### Step 4: Make Your Changes

Use the TDD workflow (we'll guide you):
1. **RED**: Write a failing test
2. **GREEN**: Make it pass with minimal code
3. **REFACTOR**: Make it beautiful

**Never written tests before?** That's okay! Look at existing tests in the `tests/` directory and pattern-match. We'll help you in code review.

### Step 5: Submit Your Pull Request

1. Push your changes to your fork
2. Open a PR using our template
3. Fill out the description (what/why/how)
4. Wait for code review

**Code review feedback is NOT criticism** - it's collaborative improvement! We'll teach you, not judge you.

### Step 6: Celebrate!

Once your PR is merged:
- You're officially a cmdai contributor! 🎉
- Your name goes in the CHANGELOG
- You've made the terminal safer for everyone
- You've earned serious Rust/Open-Source cred

## Common Questions from First-Timers

### "I don't know Rust well enough"
**That's literally the best reason to contribute!** You'll learn by doing, with expert guidance. Start with documentation or safety patterns (which use regex, not complex Rust).

### "What if my code isn't good enough?"
**There's no such thing as "not good enough."** We'll work together in code review to make it great. Every expert was once a beginner.

### "I'm afraid of breaking something"
**We have tests for that!** The test suite will catch issues. Plus, code review is another safety net. You literally cannot break production from a PR.

### "I don't have time for a big contribution"
**Small contributions are AMAZING!** Fix a typo, add a single safety pattern, write one test. We celebrate all contributions equally.

### "Can I contribute to documentation instead of code?"
**PLEASE DO!** Documentation is just as important as code. Maybe more important! Clear docs help everyone.

## Special First-Timer Programs

### The Safety Pattern Challenge
Add a new dangerous command pattern to our validation system:
1. Research a dangerous command (e.g., `chmod 777 /`, `rm -rf ~`)
2. Write a regex pattern to detect it
3. Add a test case
4. Document why it's dangerous

**Perfect for**: Security-conscious contributors, shell experts, regex fans

### The Documentation Bounty
Pick any function without documentation and add rustdoc comments:
1. Find a function in `src/` without doc comments
2. Add `///` documentation
3. Include an example
4. Run `cargo doc --open` to see your work!

**Perfect for**: Writers, technical communicators, Rust learners

### The Test Coverage Quest
Pick any module and increase its test coverage:
1. Look at coverage reports (we'll show you how)
2. Find untested code paths
3. Write tests for them
4. Watch the green checkmarks appear!

**Perfect for**: QA-minded folks, systematic thinkers, detail lovers

## How We Support First-Timers

### 1. **Dedicated Mentorship**
Every first-timer gets assigned a mentor who will:
- Answer questions (no question is too basic)
- Review your code with kindness and clarity

- Celebrate your progress

### 2. **Detailed Issue Templates**
Every good-first-issue includes:
- Clear description of the problem
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Links to relevant documentation
- Expected outcome
- Test cases to write

### 3. **Welcoming Code Review**
Our code reviews focus on:
- **Teaching**, not gatekeeping
- **Explaining why**, not just what
- **Suggesting improvements** with examples
- **Celebrating what you did well**

### 4. **No Judgement Zone**
We believe:
- Everyone learns at their own pace
