## 🎯 Decision Points

### **Should I launch this Thursday or wait?**

**Launch Thursday if**:
- ✅ README.md is polished
- ✅ You have 2+ hours to monitor HN on launch day
- ✅ You're mentally ready for engagement
- ✅ The code runs (MVP is sufficient)

**Wait a week if**:
- ❌ Major bugs in the MVP
- ❌ README is confusing
- ❌ You're traveling/unavailable on launch day
- ❌ You're not emotionally ready

**Reality**: Waiting for "perfect" is a trap. Launch when "good enough."

---

### **Version A or Version B for HN?**

**Use Version A (Conservative) if**:
- First time launching on HN
- Want to focus on technical discussion
- Uncomfortable with public ambition
- Testing the waters

**Use Version B (Ambitious) if**:
- Confident in the vision
- Want to attract co-founders specifically
- Ready to discuss business model
- Second launch (after V1.0)

**Recommendation**: Start with Version A. Less risk, easier to engage.

---

### **Should I record videos myself or hire?**

**DIY if**:
- Budget: <$1,000
- Time: 20-30 hours
- You're comfortable on camera
- Authenticity > production quality

**Hire if**:
- Budget: $2-5K
- Time: <5 hours (your time)
- Professional quality matters
- You hate video editing

**Recommendation**: DIY for Video 1 (demo), hire for Video 3 (vision) if budget allows.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Engagement Over Points**
- Better: 20 upvotes + 10 engaged commenters
- Worse: 200 upvotes + 5 comments

Why? Those 10 commenters might become contributors or co-founders.

### **Be Human**
- Admit limitations ("This doesn't work on Windows yet, PRs welcome!")
- Thank everyone
- Respond even to criticism (gracefully)
- Show personality

### **Move Fast**
- Respond to GitHub issues within 24 hours
- Welcome Discord members by name
- Merge good PRs quickly (don't overthink)
- Ship small improvements daily

### **Community > Code**
- People remember how you made them feel
- Helpful maintainers build strong communities
- Contributors stay for the people, not just the project

---

## 🆘 What If Things Go Wrong?

### **Scenario 1: HN post gets <20 upvotes**

**Don't panic.** This happens to many projects.

**Next steps**:
- Engage deeply with the comments you do get
- Post on Reddit (sometimes better reception)
- Try again in 1 month with V1.0
- Focus on other channels (Twitter, Dev.to)

**Reality**: PostHog's first launch got ~50 upvotes. They're at $40M ARR now.

---

### **Scenario 2: No one joins Discord**

**This is normal** in the first week.

**Next steps**:
- Keep the invite visible (README, HN comments)
- Post Discord link in every GitHub issue
- Personal invites to engaged users
- Highlight Discord in video content

**Give it time**: 100 members takes 1-2 months, not 1 week.

---

### **Scenario 3: Contributors submit low-quality PRs**

**This is actually good news** (people care!).

**Next steps**:
- Politely request changes (use review comments)
- Offer to pair program
- Link to CONTRIBUTING.md
- Thank them for trying

**Remember**: Every contributor started somewhere. Be patient.

---

### **Scenario 4: No co-founder interest**

**Common in early stages.**

**Next steps**:
- Build more traction first (1,000+ stars)
- Try YC Startup School (community there)
- Attend conferences (meet people IRL)
- Consider starting solo, hiring CTO later

**Timeline**: Finding a co-founder can take 3-6 months. Don't rush.

---
