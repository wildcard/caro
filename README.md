# cmdai

> 🚧 **Early Development Stage** - Architecture defined, core implementation in progress

**cmdai** converts natural language descriptions into safe POSIX shell commands using local LLMs. Built with Rust for blazing-fast performance, single-binary distribution, and safety-first design.

```bash
$ cmdai "list all PDF files in Downloads folder larger than 10MB"
Generated command:
  find ~/Downloads -name "*.pdf" -size +10M -ls

Execute this command? (y/N) y
```

### Core Components

1. **CommandGenerator Trait** - Unified interface for all LLM backends
2. **SafetyValidator** - Command validation and risk assessment
3. **Backend System** - Extensible architecture for multiple inference engines
4. **Cache Manager** - Hugging Face model management (planned)

### Backend Architecture

```rust
#[async_trait]
trait CommandGenerator {
    async fn generate_command(&self, request: &CommandRequest) 
        -> Result<GeneratedCommand, GeneratorError>;
    async fn is_available(&self) -> bool;
    fn backend_info(&self) -> BackendInfo;
}
```

## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.75+ 
- Cargo
- Make (optional, for convenience commands)
- Docker (optional, for development container)

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone and enter the project
git clone https://github.com/wildcard/cmdai.git
cd cmdai

# Install dependencies and build
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check formatting
cargo fmt -- --check

# Run clippy linter
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

### Backend Configuration

cmdai supports multiple inference backends with automatic fallback:

#### Embedded Backend (Default)
- **MLX**: Optimized for Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3)
- **CPU**: Cross-platform fallback using Candle framework
- Model: Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct (quantized)
- No external dependencies required

#### Remote Backends (Optional)
Configure in `~/.config/cmdai/config.toml`:

```toml
[backend]
primary = "embedded"  # or "ollama", "vllm"
enable_fallback = true

[backend.ollama]
base_url = "http://localhost:11434"
model_name = "codellama:7b"

[backend.vllm]
base_url = "http://localhost:8000"
model_name = "codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf"
api_key = "optional-api-key"
```

### Project Configuration

The project uses several configuration files:
- `Cargo.toml` - Rust dependencies and build configuration
- `~/.config/cmdai/config.toml` - User configuration
- `clippy.toml` - Linter rules
- `rustfmt.toml` - Code formatting rules
- `deny.toml` - Dependency audit configuration

### Testing Strategy

The project uses contract-based testing:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for backend implementations
- Contract tests to ensure trait compliance
- Property-based testing for safety validation

## 🛡️ Safety Features

cmdai includes comprehensive safety validation to prevent dangerous operations:

### Implemented Safety Checks
- ✅ System destruction patterns (`rm -rf /`, `rm -rf ~`)
- ✅ Fork bombs detection (`:(){:|:&};:`)
- ✅ Disk operations (`mkfs`, `dd if=/dev/zero`)
- ✅ Privilege escalation detection (`sudo su`, `chmod 777 /`)
- ✅ Critical path protection (`/bin`, `/usr`, `/etc`)
- ✅ Command validation and sanitization

### Risk Levels
- **Safe** (Green) - Normal operations, no confirmation needed
- **Moderate** (Yellow) - Requires user confirmation in strict mode
- **High** (Orange) - Requires confirmation in moderate mode
- **Critical** (Red) - Blocked in strict mode, requires explicit confirmation

### Safety Configuration
Configure safety levels in `~/.config/cmdai/config.toml`:
```toml
[safety]
enabled = true
level = "moderate"  # strict, moderate, or permissive
require_confirmation = true
custom_patterns = ["additional", "dangerous", "patterns"]
```
