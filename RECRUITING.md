## FAQ

### For Employees

**Q: What's the work-life balance like?**
A: We believe in sustainable pace. No crunch culture. 40-45 hours/week. Take vacations. We're building a marathon company, not a sprint.

**Q: What's the equity worth?**
A: If we hit our plan ($50M ARR by 2028), a Series A ($40M valuation) 1% equity grant could be worth $400K-4M+ at exit. Of course, this is risky - most startups fail. But the upside is real.

**Q: Is this remote?**
A: Yes, fully remote. We may have optional annual offsites, but day-to-day is remote.

**Q: What if I don't know Rust?**
A: Willingness to learn > current expertise. We'll support you ramping up. Rust is learnable (especially if you know C++/Go/Java).

**Q: When do I start getting paid?**
A: From day 1. No unpaid "trial period." You're an employee with salary + benefits.

---

### For Contributors

**Q: I'm new to open source. Can I still contribute?**
A: Absolutely! We have `good-first-issue` labels specifically for newcomers. Start small, learn, grow.

**Q: How much time do I need to commit?**
A: As much or as little as you want. Some contributors do 1 hour/week. Others do 20 hours/week. Any contribution helps.

**Q: Will I be hired if I contribute enough?**
A: Maybe! We look at top contributors when hiring. But contribute because you want to learn and build, not just for a job. The best outcomes happen when passion aligns with opportunity.

**Q: What if I disagree with a design decision?**
A: Great! We want diverse perspectives. Open a GitHub Discussion, share your reasoning, propose alternatives. We're community-driven, not dictatorial.

**Q: Can I contribute to the paid/enterprise features?**
A: Some enterprise features will be closed-source (for business reasons). But the core CLI, cloud connector, and most platform features will be open. We'll be transparent about what's open vs. closed.
