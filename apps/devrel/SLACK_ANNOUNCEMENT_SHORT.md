## 🎮 NEW: cmdai DevRel Website (8-Bit Edition!)

Hey everyone!

We just kicked off a new sub-project: **cmdai's official Developer Relations website** with a retro 8-bit pixel art design! 🕹️

### What it is
A landing page that markets cmdai, recruits contributors, and showcases our features - all wrapped in Game Boy-inspired aesthetics with neon terminal vibes. 💚

### What's ready
✅ Complete Next.js 16 setup in `apps/devrel/`
✅ Hero, Features, Docs, Contributors sections
✅ Full design system with pixel fonts & animations
✅ Comprehensive docs for the team

### Try it locally
```bash
cd apps/devrel
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Team leads

**💻 Sulo** - Frontend dev, mobile, accessibility, Figma

### How to help
