# Kyaro Character and Artwork License
Copyright (c) 2025 Kobi Kadosh, Alrezky Caesaria, and Morning Moon Studios. All rights reserved.

This license applies **only** to the Kyaro character and related artwork contained in this repository, including but not limited to:
- All pixel art, sprites, and animations
- ASCII and ANSI artwork
- Aseprite and PNG (frame-by-frame animation) files
These files are collectively referred to as the “Kyaro Assets”.
The software code in this repository is licensed separately under the license stated in the main LICENSE file. The Kyaro Assets are **not** licensed under the same terms as the code.

## 1. Permitted use
You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to:
- Use, view, and reproduce the Kyaro Assets **only as part of this original project**, for the purpose of running, testing, or contributing to this repository.

## 2. Prohibited use
Unless you have prior written permission from both copyright holders, you may **not**:
- Use the Kyaro Assets in any other project, product, or service.
- Redistribute the Kyaro Assets separately from this repository.
- Redistribute modified or unmodified versions of the Kyaro Assets as your own work.
- Use the Kyaro character or artwork for commercial purposes.
- Include the Kyaro Assets in any forks, derivatives, or redistributions that are presented as your own project, product, or brand.
If you redistribute this software or a modified version of it, you must **exclude** the Kyaro Assets unless you have explicit permission to include them.

## 3. Ownership
The Kyaro Assets are jointly owned by:
- Kobi Kadosh (project owner), and
- Alrezky Caesaria (artist and creator of the artwork).
- Morning Moon Studios (a pixel art design studio where the assets are created)
All rights not expressly granted in this license are reserved.

## 4. No warranty
The Kyaro Assets are provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
If you would like to use Kyaro or any of the Kyaro Assets outside the scope of this license, please contact the copyright holders to request permission.
If you want, I can also draft a short snippet to add to the main README.md to clearly separate the GPL code license from the Kyaro asset license.
