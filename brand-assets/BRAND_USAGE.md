## ❌ What You Are NOT Allowed To Do

You **MAY NOT** use cmdai's brand assets:

### 1. For Forks or Derivative Projects

If you fork cmdai or create a derivative project:

❌ **You CANNOT use**:
- The name "cmdai" (or confusingly similar names)
- The ⚡🛡️ logo or any cmdai logos
- The safety color system as a brand identifier
- Our signature slogans
- The terminal green color as your primary brand color

✅ **You MUST**:
- Create your own distinct name
- Design your own logo and brand identity
- Make it clear you're a fork/derivative (not the original)

**Why?** We need to ensure users can distinguish the official cmdai project from forks or variants. This protects both the project and users.

### 2. To Represent Other Products or Services

❌ **You CANNOT**:
- Use cmdai branding for your company, product, or service
- Use cmdai logos in your app/tool unless it's actually cmdai
- Combine cmdai brand elements with other brands
- Use "cmdai" in your product name (e.g., "cmdai Pro", "cmdai Enterprise")

**Exception**: You may use phrases like "Works with cmdai" or "cmdai integration" to describe compatibility, as long as it's clear you're not the official project.

### 3. To Modify or Remix Brand Assets

❌ **You CANNOT**:
- Change colors, fonts, or layouts of cmdai logos
- Create variations or alternate versions of the logo
- Combine the ⚡🛡️ symbol with other elements
- Redraw or trace the brand elements
- Animate the logo in new ways (use our official animations)
- Create "inspired by" versions that copy our style

**Why?** The CC BY-ND 4.0 license explicitly prohibits derivatives. We want one consistent cmdai brand identity.

### 4. In Ways That Confuse or Mislead

❌ **You CANNOT**:
- Suggest official endorsement when there isn't any
- Imply partnership or affiliation without permission
- Make it unclear whether you're part of the official project
- Use cmdai branding more prominently than your own
- Register trademarks confusingly similar to "cmdai"

## 🔍 For Forks & Derivatives

### If You Fork cmdai on GitHub

**The Code**: You can fork the code under AGPL-3.0.

**The Brand**: You **must** remove or replace all brand assets:
- Change the project name
- Design a new logo
- Create new color schemes and slogans
- Update all documentation to reflect new branding

**Example approach**:
```diff
- Name: cmdai
+ Name: safeshell

- Logo: ⚡🛡️
+ Logo: [your unique logo]

- Colors: Terminal Green (#00FF41)
+ Colors: [your color palette]

- Tagline: "AI-Powered Commands. Human-Level Safety."
+ Tagline: [your unique tagline]
```

### Why This Matters

Forks are great for the ecosystem! But:
- Users need to know which is the "official" cmdai
- We can't maintain quality/safety for forks
- Brand confusion can harm both projects

Creating distinct branding helps everyone.
