## LinkedIn Post Templates

### Launch Post
```
🚀 Introducing cmdai: AI-powered shell commands with built-in safety validation.

We've all seen AI code assistants generate amazing commands.
We've also seen them suggest `rm -rf /`.

cmdai validates EVERY command before execution:
✓ Pattern matching for dangerous operations
✓ POSIX compliance checking
✓ Risk-level assessment (Green/Yellow/Red)
✓ Local LLM inference (your data stays private)

Open source (AGPL-3.0) • Built with Rust • <100ms validation

Because "YOLO" is not a deployment strategy.

Try it: [link]

#AI #DevTools #OpenSource #Rust #TerminalSafety
```

### Feature Highlight Post
```
⚡ How fast is cmdai?

Startup: <100ms
Validation: <50ms
Command generation: <2s (M1 Mac)

That's faster than you can type "man grep".

And every single command is safety-validated before execution.

Speed AND safety. Not speed OR safety.

## The Ultimate Slogan (When You Need ONE)

If you can only use ONE slogan across all contexts:

**"AI-Powered Commands. Human-Level Safety."**

It's:
- ✅ Clear value proposition
- ✅ Balanced (innovation + responsibility)
- ✅ Professional enough for enterprises
- ✅ Simple enough for developers
- ✅ Differentiating (most AI tools don't emphasize safety)
- ✅ Memorable and easy to repeat

## Testing Your Messaging

Good brand messaging should:
1. **Pass the t-shirt test** - Would you wear it?
2. **Pass the tweet test** - Does it fit in 280 chars?
3. **Pass the elevator test** - Can you say it in 5 seconds?
4. **Pass the grandma test** - Would a non-technical person get it?
5. **Pass the competitor test** - Could this apply to a competitor?

If #5 is "yes", the messaging isn't differentiated enough.

---

**Remember:** The best slogan is the one people actually repeat.

Keep it simple. Keep it memorable. Keep it honest.

⚡🛡️ Think Fast. Stay Safe.
