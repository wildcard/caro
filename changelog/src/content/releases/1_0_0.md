breaking: true
security: true
---

This is the first stable release of Caro, establishing a security-critical CLI tool that converts natural language to safe shell commands.

## Breaking Changes

**Project renamed from `caro` to `caro`**

- Binary name: `caro` -> `caro`
- Crate name: `caro` -> `caro`
- Package name on crates.io: `caro`

### Migration Guide

```bash
# Uninstall old version
cargo uninstall caro

# Install new version
cargo install caro

# Remove any shell aliases pointing to caro
# Check ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc for: alias caro='caro'
```

## Feature 004: Embedded Model + Remote Backend Support

### Embedded Model Backend

**EmbeddedModelBackend**: Primary inference backend with platform-specific optimizations:

- **MLX backend** for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) with GPU acceleration
- **CPU backend** using Candle framework for cross-platform support
- Lazy model loading with <2s initialization time
- Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct model with Q4_K_M quantization (~1.1GB)
- JSON response parsing with multiple fallback strategies
- Simulated inference for testing (~500ms MLX, ~800ms CPU)

### Remote Backends

**OllamaBackend**: Local Ollama server integration:
- HTTP API client with configurable timeout
- Automatic fallback to embedded backend on failure
- JSON request/response handling with robust parsing

**VllmBackend**: OpenAI-compatible vLLM server support:
- Bearer token authentication for API access
- Chat completion endpoint integration
- Embedded backend fallback on connection failure

### CLI Integration

**CliApp**: Enhanced with backend selection and user interaction:
- Configuration-driven backend selection
- Interactive confirmation for dangerous commands
- Non-terminal environment detection with graceful fallback
- Multiple output formats (JSON, YAML, Plain text)
- Verbose mode with timing and debug information

### Safety System Integration

**Risk Assessment**: Command safety validation:
- Critical commands blocked with explanatory messages
- Moderate/high risk commands require confirmation
- Permissive mode for advanced users
- Custom dangerous pattern definitions

### User Interaction

**Interactive Confirmations**: Safe command execution:
- Color-coded risk indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Terminal detection for interactive prompts
- `--confirm/-y` flag for automation
- Helpful guidance in non-interactive environments

## Feature 003: Core Infrastructure Modules

### Cache Module

**CacheManager**: Model caching with Hugging Face integration:
- LRU eviction algorithm for cache size management
- SHA256 checksum validation for model integrity
- Offline-first operation with manifest persistence
- XDG Base Directory compliance for cross-platform support

### Config Module

**ConfigManager**: TOML-based configuration management:
- Load/save user preferences with validation
- CLI argument override support (`merge_with_cli`)
- Environment variable override support (`merge_with_env`)
- Schema validation with deprecated key warnings

### Execution Module

**ExecutionContext**: System context capture for LLM prompts:
- Current directory, shell type, platform detection
- Environment variable capture with sensitive data filtering
- Username/hostname detection (cross-platform)
- Serialization for LLM prompt integration

### Logging Module

**Logger**: Structured logging with tracing integration:
- JSON and plain text format support
- Log level configuration (Debug, Info, Warn, Error)
- File and stdout output options
- Operation span tracking for performance monitoring
- Pattern-based redaction of API_KEY, TOKEN, PASSWORD, SECRET

## Performance

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Embedded model initialization | <2s | <2s |
| Command generation | <1s | 500-800ms |
| Remote backend fallback | <5s | <5s |
| CLI startup (debug) | <100ms | <100ms |
| CLI startup (release) | <50ms | <50ms |
| Context capture | <50ms | <50ms |
| Config loading | <100ms | <100ms |

## Testing

- 44 library unit tests passing
- 9 system integration tests passing
- 9 embedded backend integration tests passing
- Remote backend fallback scenarios validated
- Safety validation comprehensive test coverage
- Multi-platform CI/CD pipeline configured

## Build & Distribution

- **Multi-platform builds**: Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Architecture support**: x86_64, aarch64
- **Feature flags**:
  - `embedded-cpu`: CPU backend (default)
  - `embedded-mlx`: Apple Silicon MLX backend
  - `remote-backends`: Ollama/vLLM support

## Security

This release establishes comprehensive security controls:

**Release Security**:
- Controlled release process with verified maintainers only
- GPG-signed tags required for all releases
- Automated CI/CD security checks (cargo audit, clippy)
- crates.io publish tokens with minimal scope (publish-update only)

**Command Safety**:
- Comprehensive dangerous command pattern detection
- Risk level assessment (Safe, Moderate, High, Critical)
- Interactive confirmation for potentially dangerous operations
- Blocked commands with clear explanatory messages
- POSIX compliance validation

**Dependency Security**:
- All dependencies vetted for security vulnerabilities
- Minimal dependency tree to reduce attack surface
- Regular security audits via `cargo audit`
- Pinned versions for reproducible builds

**Development Security**:
- 2FA required for all maintainer accounts
- Signed commits for release-related changes
- Branch protection on main branch
- Required code reviews for all changes

See `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` for complete security procedures.

## First Release Highlights

- Single binary under 50MB (without embedded model)
- Startup time < 100ms
- First inference < 2s on Apple Silicon
- Comprehensive safety validation
- Multi-backend support (MLX, Ollama, vLLM)
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Security-first development process

## Known Limitations

- ARM64 Linux binary builds may fail due to OpenSSL cross-compilation issues (users can compile from source)
- Embedded models require manual download and caching
- MLX backend requires Apple Silicon hardware
