## Fixed

### Cross-Platform Binary Distribution

**OpenSSL dependency removed**: Switched `hf-hub` and `tokenizers` from `native-tls` to `rustls-tls`:

- Eliminates system OpenSSL dependency for cross-compilation
- Enables successful ARM64 Linux builds without OpenSSL headers
- Pure Rust TLS stack works across all platforms without system dependencies
- Fixes failed v1.0.1 release where no binaries were attached to GitHub release

### CI/CD Improvements

**Release workflow resilience**: Added `fail-fast: false` to build matrix:

- Platform builds now run independently
- One platform failure doesn't cancel other builds
- Ensures maximum binary availability even if individual platforms fail

## Technical Details

### Dependency Changes

```toml
hf-hub = { default-features = false, features = ["tokio", "rustls-tls"] }
tokenizers = { default-features = false, features = ["http", "rustls-tls", "onig"] }
```

### Platform Compatibility
Binaries work on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch, Alpine, WSL without OpenSSL.

### Binary Size
No impact - rustls is similar size to native-tls when statically linked.
