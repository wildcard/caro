## 🎓 Best Practices

### Asking for Help

**Good question:**
```
I'm trying to configure cmdai to use Ollama backend, but I'm getting
a connection error. Here's my config:

[backend]
primary = "ollama"
[backend.ollama]
base_url = "http://localhost:11434"

And the error:
"connection refused at localhost:11434"

I've verified Ollama is running with `ollama list`. Any ideas?
```

**Needs improvement:**
```
cmdai doesn't work help!!!
```

**Template:**
1. What you're trying to do
2. What you tried
3. What happened instead
4. Relevant config/error messages
5. Your environment (OS, cmdai version)

---

### Providing Feedback

**Good feedback:**
```
This approach works, but I'm concerned about performance with large files.
Have you considered using a streaming approach instead?

Example: [code snippet or link]

What do you think?
```

**Needs improvement:**
```
This code is slow. Rewrite it.
```

**Template:**
1. Acknowledge what's working
2. Explain the concern
3. Suggest an alternative
4. Ask, don't demand

---

### Disagreeing Respectfully

**Good disagreement:**
```
I see your point about [X], but I'm concerned that [Y]. Here's why...

I think we should consider [alternative approach] because [reasoning].

What am I missing?
```

**Needs improvement:**
```
That's wrong. You clearly don't understand [X].
```

**Template:**
1. Acknowledge their perspective
2. State your concern
3. Propose alternative
4. Invite dialogue
5. Assume you might be wrong
