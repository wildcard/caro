## Platform-Specific Strategies

### Twitter/X

**Hashtag Limit:** 2-3 hashtags per tweet (more looks spammy)

**Recommended Combinations:**

**Launch Post:**
```
#cmdai #SafeAI #OpenSource
```

**Technical Post:**
```
#cmdai #RustLang #LocalLLM
```

**Security Post:**
```
#cmdai #DevSecOps #SafeAI
```

**Community Post:**
```
#cmdai #OpenSource #BuildInPublic
```

**Engagement Hack:**
- Primary hashtag in tweet text naturally
- Secondary hashtags at the end
- Campaign hashtag (#ThinkFastStaySafe) in replies/QTs

**Example:**
```
We just launched cmdai - a safety validator for AI-generated commands.

Every command gets validated before execution. Red/yellow/green system so you always know the risk.

Open source. Built with Rust. Ships as a single binary.

Try it: [link]

#cmdai #SafeAI #RustLang
```

---

### LinkedIn

**Hashtag Limit:** 3-5 hashtags (LinkedIn encourages more)

**Recommended Combinations:**

**For technical audience:**
```
#SoftwareEngineering #Rust #OpenSource #DeveloperTools #AI
```

**For security audience:**
```
#CyberSecurity #DevSecOps #ApplicationSecurity #RiskManagement #AIGovernance
```

**For leadership audience:**
```
#TechLeadership #Engineering #Innovation #AITools #OpenSource
```

**For community posts:**
```
#OpenSource #DeveloperCommunity #BuildInPublic #Rust #Collaboration
```

**Placement Strategy:**
- Hashtags at the END of post (LinkedIn best practice)
- Use less common hashtags for better targeting
- Avoid #AI alone (too broad)

---

### Reddit

**Don't use hashtags in post text** (Reddit culture doesn't do this)

**Exception:** Flair/tags if subreddit requires

**Tracking:** Monitor mentions of cmdai in relevant subreddits

---

### GitHub

**Use topic tags on repository:**
- `rust`
- `cli`
- `ai`
- `safety`
- `llm`
- `developer-tools`
- `command-line`
- `mlx`
- `ollama`
- `security`

**Use labels on issues/PRs:**
- `good-first-issue`
- `help-wanted`
- `security`
- `performance`
- `documentation`

---

### Mastodon/Fediverse

**Hashtag Culture:** Heavy hashtag use is normal and encouraged

**Recommended:**
```
#cmdai #SafeAI #RustLang #OpenSource #LocalLLM #CLI #DevTools #TerminalSafety
```

**Note:** Fediverse users discover content through hashtags (no algorithm)

**Strategy:**
- Use 5-8 hashtags
- Be specific AND broad
- Use CamelCase for accessibility (#RustLang not #rustlang)

---

## Hashtag Research & Tracking

## Competitor Hashtag Analysis

### What Hashtags Are Similar Tools Using?

**GitHub Copilot:**
- #GitHubCopilot, #Copilot, #AICodeAssistant
- **Takeaway:** They own the "code assistant" space. We differentiate with "safety validator"

**Warp Terminal:**
- #WarpTerminal, #ModernTerminal, #TerminalOfTheFuture
- **Takeaway:** They focus on "modern." We focus on "safe."

**Fig (now deprecated):**
- #Fig, #TerminalAutocomplete, #DevTools
- **Takeaway:** Autocomplete niche. Different from our safety focus.

**Tabnine:**
- #Tabnine, #AICode, #CodeCompletion
- **Takeaway:** Code completion space. We don't compete directly.

### Our Differentiation in Hashtags
We should OWN:
- #SafeAI (safety-first positioning)
- #TerminalSafety (specific niche)
- #AIGuardrails (validator concept)
- #cmdai (our brand)

We can SHARE:
- #DevTools, #OpenSource, #RustLang (ecosystem tags)

We should AVOID:
- #AICodeAssistant (copilot owns this)
- #CodeCompletion (not our focus)
