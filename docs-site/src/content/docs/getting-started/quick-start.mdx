# Quick Start

This guide will get you productive with caro in just a few minutes.

## Basic Usage

The simplest way to use caro is to describe what you want to do:

```bash
caro "your natural language description"
```

<Steps>
1. **Type your command description** in quotes
2. **Review the generated command** shown in the terminal
3. **Execute** by copying the command or piping it to your shell
</Steps>

## Common Examples

### File Operations

```bash
# Find files
caro "find all python files"
# Output: find . -name "*.py"

caro "find files larger than 100MB"
# Output: find . -size +100M

caro "find files modified in the last 24 hours"
# Output: find . -mtime 0
```

### Text Search

```bash
# Search content
caro "search for TODO in all source files"
# Output: grep -r "TODO" --include="*.{py,js,rs,go}"

caro "find lines containing error in log files"
# Output: grep -i "error" *.log

caro "count occurrences of function in all rust files"
# Output: grep -c "function" *.rs
```

### System Information

```bash
# System commands
caro "show disk usage"
# Output: df -h

caro "show running processes sorted by memory"
# Output: ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -20

caro "show network connections"
# Output: netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
```

### Directory Operations

```bash
# Directory management
caro "show directory size"
# Output: du -sh .

caro "list directories sorted by size"
# Output: du -sh */ | sort -hr

caro "create directory structure for a rust project"
# Output: mkdir -p src/{bin,lib} tests docs
```

## Understanding the Output

caro provides colored output to help you understand the command:

```
$ caro "find all rust files modified today"

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  find . -name "*.rs" -mtime 0           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Risk: Safe ✓
```

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Command box | The generated shell command |
| Risk level | Safety assessment (Safe, Moderate, High, Critical) |
| Checkmark | Indicates the command passed safety validation |

## Safety Features

caro automatically validates commands for safety:

```bash
# This will be blocked
$ caro "delete everything"

⚠️  Command blocked: Potentially dangerous pattern detected
    Pattern: rm -rf /
    Risk: Critical

# Safe alternative suggested
Tip: Try "caro 'delete files in current directory'" for a safer approach
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Never blindly execute generated commands. Always review them first, especially when dealing with file operations.
</Aside>

## Command Execution Options

### Copy and Paste (Recommended)

Review the command, then copy and paste to execute:

```bash
$ caro "find large log files"
find . -name "*.log" -size +10M

# Copy the command and paste to execute
$ find . -name "*.log" -size +10M
```

### Direct Execution (Use Carefully)

For trusted commands, you can pipe directly to your shell:

```bash
# ⚠️ Use with caution - only for well-understood commands
caro "show current date" | sh
```

<Aside type="danger">
  Piping to `sh` bypasses your ability to review the command. Only use this for simple, safe operations you fully understand.
</Aside>

## Tips for Better Results

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="pencil">
    More detail = better results. Instead of "find files", try "find python files modified this week".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Constraints" icon="approve-check">
    Add limits like "in current directory" or "excluding node_modules".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Describe the Goal" icon="rocket">
    Say what you want to achieve, not how. "compress images for web" beats "run imagemagick".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Iterate" icon="seti:todo">
    If the first result isn't perfect, refine your description and try again.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Good vs. Bad Prompts

| Bad Prompt | Good Prompt |
|------------|-------------|
| "files" | "find all PDF files in the downloads folder" |
| "search" | "search for 'TODO' comments in python files" |
| "compress" | "compress all jpg files to 80% quality" |
| "ports" | "show which process is using port 8080" |

## Workflow Examples

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Find uncommitted changes
caro "show git status with diff stats"
# Output: git status -sb && git diff --stat

# Find TODO comments
caro "find TODO comments in src directory"
# Output: grep -rn "TODO" src/

# Count lines of code
caro "count lines of rust code"
# Output: find . -name "*.rs" -exec wc -l {} + | tail -1
```

### System Administration

```bash
# Check system health
caro "show system uptime and load average"
# Output: uptime

# Find large files
caro "find files larger than 1GB"
# Output: find / -size +1G 2>/dev/null

# Check disk space
caro "show disk usage by directory sorted by size"
# Output: du -sh */ | sort -hr
```

### Data Processing

```bash
# CSV operations
caro "show first 10 lines of CSV file"
# Output: head -10 file.csv

caro "count unique values in second column of CSV"
# Output: cut -d',' -f2 file.csv | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# JSON processing
caro "extract name field from JSON"
# Output: jq '.name' file.json
```
