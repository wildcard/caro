# Quick Start

This guide will get you productive with caro in just a few minutes.

## Installation

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Quick Install (Recommended)">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wildcard/caro/main/install.sh | bash
    ```

    The install script will:
    - Install via Cargo if Rust is available (with MLX optimization on Apple Silicon)
    - Otherwise download a pre-built binary for your platform
    - Verify SHA256 checksums for security
    - Configure your PATH automatically
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Cargo">
    ```bash
    # Standard install
    cargo install caro

    # Apple Silicon with MLX GPU acceleration
    cargo install caro --features embedded-mlx
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Pre-built Binary">
    ```bash
    # Download for your platform from GitHub Releases
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/wildcard/caro/releases/latest/download/caro-$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')-$(uname -m) -o caro
    chmod +x caro
    sudo mv caro /usr/local/bin/
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Verify installation:
```bash
caro --version
# Output: caro 1.0.3
```

## Basic Usage

Simply describe what you want to do in natural language:

```bash
caro "your natural language description"
```

<Steps>
1. **Type your command description** in quotes
2. **Review the generated command** caro shows you
3. **Confirm execution** by typing `y` or copy the command
</Steps>

## Interactive Confirmation

When you run a command, caro shows the generated command and asks for confirmation:

```bash
$ caro "list all PDF files in Downloads folder larger than 10MB"

Generated command:
  find ~/Downloads -name "*.pdf" -size +10M -ls

Execute this command? (y/N) y
```

This interactive flow ensures you always review commands before execution.

## Common Examples

### File Operations

```bash
$ caro "find all python files"
Generated command:
  find . -name "*.py"

$ caro "find files larger than 100MB"
Generated command:
  find . -size +100M

$ caro "find files modified in the last 24 hours"
Generated command:
  find . -mtime 0
```

### Text Search

```bash
$ caro "search for TODO in all source files"
Generated command:
  grep -rn "TODO" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" --include="*.rs"

$ caro "find lines containing error in log files"
Generated command:
  grep -i "error" *.log

$ caro "count occurrences of function in all rust files"
Generated command:
  grep -c "fn " *.rs
```

### System Information

```bash
$ caro "show disk usage"
Generated command:
  df -h

$ caro "show running processes sorted by memory"
Generated command:
  ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -20

$ caro "show network connections"
Generated command:
  netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
```

### Directory Operations

```bash
$ caro "show directory size"
Generated command:
  du -sh .

$ caro "list directories sorted by size"
Generated command:
  du -sh */ | sort -hr

$ caro "create directory structure for a rust project"
Generated command:
  mkdir -p src/{bin,lib} tests docs
```

## Understanding the Output

caro provides colored output with safety assessment:

```
$ caro "find all rust files modified today"

Generated command:
  find . -name "*.rs" -mtime 0

Risk: Safe ✓

Execute this command? (y/N)
```

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Generated command | The shell command caro created for your request |
| Risk level | Safety assessment (Safe, Moderate, High, Critical) |
| Checkmark | Indicates the command passed safety validation |
| Confirmation | Interactive prompt to execute or decline |

### Platform-Aware Generation

caro automatically detects your environment and generates platform-appropriate commands:

- **Operating system** (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- **Architecture** (x86_64, ARM64/Apple Silicon)
- **Shell type** (bash, zsh, fish)
- **Available commands** on your system

This means the same natural language prompt produces the correct command for your platform.

## Safety Features

caro automatically validates commands for safety:

```bash
# This will be blocked
$ caro "delete everything"

⚠️  Command blocked: Potentially dangerous pattern detected
    Pattern: rm -rf /
    Risk: Critical

# Safe alternative suggested
Tip: Try "caro 'delete files in current directory'" for a safer approach
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Never blindly execute generated commands. Always review them first, especially when dealing with file operations.
</Aside>

## Command Execution Options

### Interactive Confirmation (Default)

The default behavior is to show the command and ask for confirmation:

```bash
$ caro "find large log files"
Generated command:
  find . -name "*.log" -size +10M

Execute this command? (y/N) y
# Command executes...
```

### Auto-Confirmation with `--yes`

For scripting or when you trust the command, use `--yes` to skip confirmation:

```bash
# Skip confirmation prompt
caro --yes "show current date"

# Short form
caro -y "list files"
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Using `--yes` executes commands immediately without review. Only use this for well-understood operations.
</Aside>

### Copy Without Execution

Press `n` or Enter at the confirmation prompt to decline execution - the command remains visible for you to copy:

```bash
$ caro "find large log files"
Generated command:
  find . -name "*.log" -size +10M

Execute this command? (y/N) n
# Command not executed - copy it manually if desired
```

## Tips for Better Results

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="pencil">
    More detail = better results. Instead of "find files", try "find python files modified this week".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Constraints" icon="approve-check">
    Add limits like "in current directory" or "excluding node_modules".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Describe the Goal" icon="rocket">
    Say what you want to achieve, not how. "compress images for web" beats "run imagemagick".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Iterate" icon="seti:todo">
    If the first result isn't perfect, refine your description and try again.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Good vs. Bad Prompts

| Bad Prompt | Good Prompt |
|------------|-------------|
| "files" | "find all PDF files in the downloads folder" |
| "search" | "search for 'TODO' comments in python files" |
| "compress" | "compress all jpg files to 80% quality" |
| "ports" | "show which process is using port 8080" |

## Workflow Examples

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Find uncommitted changes
$ caro "show git status with diff stats"
Generated command:
  git status -sb && git diff --stat

# Find TODO comments
$ caro "find TODO comments in src directory"
Generated command:
  grep -rn "TODO" src/

# Count lines of code
$ caro "count lines of rust code"
Generated command:
  find . -name "*.rs" -exec wc -l {} + | tail -1
```

### System Administration

```bash
# Check system health
$ caro "show system uptime and load average"
Generated command:
  uptime

# Find large files
$ caro "find files larger than 1GB"
Generated command:
  find . -size +1G 2>/dev/null

# Check disk space
$ caro "show disk usage by directory sorted by size"
Generated command:
  du -sh */ | sort -hr
```

### Data Processing

```bash
# CSV operations
$ caro "show first 10 lines of data.csv"
Generated command:
  head -10 data.csv

$ caro "count unique values in second column of data.csv"
Generated command:
  cut -d',' -f2 data.csv | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# JSON processing
$ caro "extract name field from config.json"
Generated command:
  jq '.name' config.json
```

## CLI Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--yes` | `-y` | Auto-confirm command execution |
| `--shell <SHELL>` | `-s` | Target shell (bash, zsh, fish, sh) |
| `--output <FORMAT>` | `-o` | Output format (json, yaml, plain) |
| `--safety <LEVEL>` | | Safety level (strict, moderate, permissive) |
| `--backend <NAME>` | | Backend to use (mlx, ollama, vllm) |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Enable verbose output with timing |
| `--config <FILE>` | `-c` | Custom configuration file |

Example with options:
```bash
# Use specific shell and backend
caro --shell zsh --backend ollama "find python files"

# JSON output for scripting
caro --output json "show disk usage"

# Verbose mode for debugging
caro --verbose "search for errors in logs"
```
