## Quick Example

```bash
# Install caro
cargo install caro

# Convert natural language to shell commands
caro "find all rust files modified in the last week"
# Output: find . -name "*.rs" -mtime -7

caro "show disk usage sorted by size"
# Output: du -sh * | sort -hr

caro "count lines in all python files"
# Output: find . -name "*.py" -exec wc -l {} + | tail -1
```
