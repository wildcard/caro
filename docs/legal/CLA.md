## Dual Licensing Strategy

### Why Dual Licensing?

Caro employs a **dual licensing strategy** to:

1. **Support the Open Source Community**: Provide free access to Caro under AGPL-3.0 for individuals, open source projects, and community use
2. **Enable Enterprise Adoption**: Offer commercial licenses for organizations that:
   - Cannot comply with AGPL-3.0 requirements
   - Need proprietary modifications
   - Require enterprise support and SLAs
   - Want to integrate Caro into proprietary products

### What This Means for Contributors

By signing this CLA, You acknowledge and agree that:

1. **Your Contributions will be available under AGPL-3.0** for community use
2. **the Project may also distribute Your Contributions under commercial licenses** to enterprise customers
3. **You will not receive royalties or payment** for commercial use (contributions are voluntary)
4. **You retain attribution** - Your contributions will be credited in both open source and commercial distributions
5. **The open source version remains free** - AGPL-3.0 distribution continues regardless of commercial licensing

### Community Transparency

the Project commits to:
- **Maintaining AGPL-3.0 availability**: The community version will always remain available under AGPL-3.0
- **Contributing improvements back**: Enterprise features that improve core safety will be contributed to the open source version
- **Transparent governance**: Clear documentation of what's open source vs. commercial
- **Community recognition**: Contributors will be acknowledged in both versions

### Enterprise Features (Separate from Core)

Enterprise licensing typically covers features like:
- **Remote model runners** for organizational deployments
- **Security dashboards** showing terminal usage across the organization
- **Centralized policy management** for command safety rules
- **Audit logging and compliance** features
- **SSO/LDAP integration** for enterprise authentication
- **Priority support and SLAs**

The core command generation and safety validation remain open source under AGPL-3.0.

## Contributor Recognition

the Project values all contributions and commits to:

1. **Attribution in both versions**: Your name in CONTRIBUTORS.md for both open source and commercial distributions
2. **Changelog recognition**: Major contributions highlighted in release notes
3. **Public acknowledgment**: Recognition on project website and social media
4. **Career benefits**: Contributions visible to employers and the community
5. **Path to maintainership**: Active contributors may be invited to join the core team

## Questions About This CLA?

### Common Questions

A: Your contributions may be included in commercial/enterprise versions of Caro distributed under proprietary licenses to enterprise customers. However, the AGPL-3.0 version remains freely available.
