This license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 4. Legal Authority

You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that:
- You have received permission from Your employer to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, OR
- Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to the cmdai project, OR
- Your employer has executed a separate Corporate Contributor License Agreement with the cmdai project

### 5. Original Creation

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).

### 6. Support and Warranties

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all.

- Warranties of title
- Warranties of non-infringement
- Warranties of merchantability
- Warranties of fitness for a particular purpose

### 7. Third-Party Works

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to the cmdai project separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as:

**"Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]"**
