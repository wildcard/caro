# Caro Cookie Notice

**Last Updated:** January 2026

## TL;DR

**We don't use cookies.** This page exists for transparency.

---

## Caro CLI

Caro is a terminal application. Terminal applications don't use cookies. There's nothing more to say here.

---

## Website (caro.sh)

Our website at [caro.sh](https://caro.sh) does not use:

- Tracking cookies
- Analytics cookies (no Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.)
- Advertising cookies
- Third-party cookies
- First-party cookies for tracking

### What We Do Use

- **No cookies at all** - We're a static site with no user accounts
- Standard web server logs (IP, user-agent) retained for max 30 days for security

---

## Why This Document Exists

In the spirit of GNU and BSD transparency, we believe in being explicit about what we *don't* do, not just what we do. Many users have been conditioned to expect invasive tracking. We want to be clear: that's not us.

## Third-Party Services

### GitHub

Our repository is hosted on GitHub. When you visit our GitHub page or download releases, GitHub's cookies and policies apply. See [GitHub's Cookie Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-cookies).

### crates.io

When you install Caro via `cargo install caro`, you interact with crates.io. See [crates.io's policies](https://crates.io/policies).

### Hugging Face (Future)

When model auto-download is implemented, you may interact with Hugging Face Hub. Their policies will apply to those interactions.

## Do Not Track

We honor Do Not Track (DNT) signals by default because we don't track anything in the first place.
