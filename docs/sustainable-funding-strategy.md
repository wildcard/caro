### Premium Feature Decision Framework

**When evaluating new premium features, ask:**

1. ❓ **Does this compromise core functionality?**
   - If YES → Must be free
   - If NO → Can be premium

2. ❓ **Does this primarily add convenience or capability?**
   - Convenience → Can be premium
   - Capability → Should be free

3. ❓ **Would withholding this create significant frustration?**
   - If YES → Should be free
   - If NO → Can be premium

4. ❓ **Does this require ongoing infrastructure cost?**
   - If YES → Justifies premium pricing
   - If NO → Preference for free

5. ❓ **Is this something the community could build?**
   - If easily → Should be free/open
   - If requires significant resources → Can be premium

**Examples:**

✅ **GOOD Premium Features:**
- Cloud sync (ongoing infrastructure cost)
- Advanced analytics (convenience, not capability)
- Premium themes (polish, not power)
- Priority support (resource allocation)
- Team collaboration tools (enterprise value)

❌ **BAD Premium Features:**
- Additional backends (core capability)
- Safety validation (critical functionality)
- POSIX compliance (core value)
- Basic command history (expected feature)
- Open-source code access (violates principles)

## Part 7: Ethical Considerations & Safeguards

### Open Source Commitment

**Irrevocable Promises:**

1. **Core Always Free**
   - Command generation will never be paywalled
   - Safety validation will never be premium-only
   - Community contributions always accepted
   - AGPL license maintained

2. **Transparent Decision-Making**
   - Community input on major decisions
   - Public roadmap and priorities
   - Financial transparency
   - Open governance model

3. **Fair Premium Pricing**
   - Premium features add value, don't withhold capability
   - Free tier always viable for individuals
   - Student/nonprofit discounts
   - Regional pricing for fairness

4. **Community First**
   - Contributors recognized regardless of financial support
   - Technical merit above financial contribution
   - Code quality and community health over revenue
   - Sustainable, not extractive

### Safeguards Against Mission Drift

**Governance Model:**

```
DECISION AUTHORITY:

Core functionality changes:
- Maintainers propose
- Community discusses (2 weeks)
- Core contributors vote
- Transparency throughout

Premium features:
- Maintainers decide
- Community can petition
- Annual review of premium/free boundary
- Feedback incorporated

Financial decisions:
- Monthly financial reports
- Quarterly impact reviews
- Annual community survey
- Adjustments based on feedback
```

**Community Checks:**

1. **Annual Community Vote** on premium features
   - "Should feature X be free or premium?"
   - Binding vote with >60% threshold

2. **Financial Transparency Requirement**
   - Monthly public financial reports
   - Expense justification
   - Reserve fund disclosure

3. **Exit Strategy**
   - If project is sold or changes hands
   - Community has right to fork
   - All premium features released as OSS
   - 6-month notice period
