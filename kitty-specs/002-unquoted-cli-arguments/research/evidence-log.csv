# Evidence Log: Track all research findings with citations
#
# Column Definitions:
# - timestamp: When evidence was collected (ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
# - source_type: journal | conference | book | web | preprint | codebase | pr_review
# - citation: Full citation (BibTeX, APA, or Simple format)
# - key_finding: Main takeaway from this source (1-2 sentences)
# - confidence: high | medium | low (based on source quality and clarity)
# - notes: Additional context, caveats, or methodological notes
#
# Validation: Citations must be non-empty, source_type must be valid
# Format: BibTeX (@article{...}) or APA (Author (Year). Title.) recommended
