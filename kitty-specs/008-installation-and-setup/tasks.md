# Work Packages: Installation and Setup Documentation

**Inputs**: Design documents from `/kitty-specs/008-installation-and-setup/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (implementation architecture), spec.md (3 user stories), research.md (technical decisions), data-model.md (entities), quickstart.md (developer guide)

**Tests**: Manual testing of page rendering, responsive behavior, link validation, and accessibility. No automated tests requested by stakeholders.

**Organization**: Fine-grained subtasks (`Txxx`) roll up into work packages (`WPxx`). Each work package is independently deliverable and testable per user story priorities (P1: Quick Start, P2: Installation, P3: Setup).

**Prompt Files**: Each work package references a matching prompt file in `/tasks/planned/` generated by `/spec-kitty.tasks`. This file provides the high-level checklist; detailed implementation guidance is in the prompt files.

## Subtask Format: `[Txxx] [P?] Description`
- **[P]** indicates the subtask can proceed in parallel (different files/components).
- File paths relative to worktree root (e.g., `website/src/pages/quick-start.astro`).

## Path Conventions
- **Website pages**: `website/src/pages/`
- **Components**: `website/src/components/` (existing), `website/src/components/docs/` (new)
- **Layouts**: `website/src/layouts/` (existing, reuse Layout.astro)
- **Reference content**: `README.md`, `website/src/components/Download.astro`

## Work Package WP01: Foundation - Shared Documentation Components (Priority: P0)

**Goal**: Create reusable Astro components for all documentation pages (CodeBlock, PlatformTabs, InstallMethod, ComingSoonBadge).
**Independent Test**: Components render correctly in isolation; can be imported and used in any page.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP01-foundation-components.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T001 Create `website/src/components/docs/` directory
- [ ] T002 [P] Implement `CodeBlock.astro` with copy-to-clipboard button and syntax highlighting
- [ ] T003 [P] Implement `PlatformTabs.astro` with localStorage persistence and responsive tabs
- [ ] T004 [P] Implement `InstallMethod.astro` card component with difficulty badges
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement `ComingSoonBadge.astro` with GitHub issue linking

### Implementation Notes
- All components should match existing website design system (orange gradient, typography, spacing)
- CodeBlock uses clipboard API or library for copy functionality
- PlatformTabs should stack on mobile, display tabs on desktop
- InstallMethod shows collapsible Prerequisites and Verification sections
- ComingSoonBadge should be visually distinct (orange/yellow) and link to GitHub issues

### Parallel Opportunities
- T002-T005 are fully parallelizable (independent component files)

### Dependencies
- None (foundation work).

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Copy button browser compatibility**: Use feature detection for clipboard API; provide fallback for older browsers.
- **Design consistency**: Reference existing components (Navigation.astro, Download.astro) for color/spacing patterns.

## Work Package WP02: Quick Start Page - MVP (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Create Quick Start Guide page enabling first-time users to install and generate their first command in under 5 minutes.
**Independent Test**: New user can follow guide on clean system and successfully run first Caro command within 5 minutes.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP02-quick-start-page.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T006 Create `website/src/pages/quick-start.astro` with Layout.astro structure
- [ ] T007 Write Step 1: Install section (automated script OR cargo install)
- [ ] T008 Write Step 2: Verify installation (run `caro --version`)
- [ ] T009 Write Step 3: Generate first command example (e.g., "list all files")
- [ ] T010 Write Step 4: Next steps (links to installation.astro and setup.astro)

### Implementation Notes
- Use CodeBlock component for all commands
- Keep instructions minimal - no long explanations
- Include expected output for verification step
- Total page reading time should be < 3 minutes
- Use sequential numbered steps (1-4)

### Parallel Opportunities
- Content writing (T007-T010) can be drafted in parallel once page structure exists

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP01 (requires CodeBlock component).

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Automated script availability**: If script doesn't exist, use "cargo install caro" as primary method and note automated script as "Coming Soon".
- **Backend confusion**: Clearly state which backend is used by default (likely Ollama or vLLM) to avoid user confusion.

## Work Package WP03: Installation Page - Comprehensive Methods (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Create Installation page documenting all installation methods (automated script, cargo, binaries, source build, package managers).
**Independent Test**: Power user can find their preferred installation method and successfully install Caro.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP03-installation-page.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T011 Create `website/src/pages/installation.astro` with Layout.astro structure
- [ ] T012 Extract installation content from `README.md`
- [ ] T013 Write Automated Script section (featured at top with large code block)
- [ ] T014 Write Cargo Install section using InstallMethod component
- [ ] T015 Write Pre-built Binaries section with platform-specific downloads (macOS, Linux)
- [ ] T016 Write Build from Source section with dependency list and build commands
- [ ] T017 Write Package Managers section (Homebrew, apt, AUR) with ComingSoonBadge
- [ ] T018 Write Troubleshooting section (common issues and solutions)
- [ ] T019 Write Uninstall instructions section

### Implementation Notes
- Automated script should be prominently featured (hero section)
- Each manual method should use InstallMethod component for consistency
- Include verification commands for each method
- Mark unsupported methods with ComingSoonBadge
- Extract actual commands from README.md to ensure accuracy

### Parallel Opportunities
- Content sections (T013-T019) can be drafted in parallel after structure is created

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP01 (requires InstallMethod and ComingSoonBadge components).

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Content accuracy**: Verify all commands work before documenting; test on clean systems.
- **Binary availability**: Check if pre-built binaries exist in GitHub releases; mark as "Coming Soon" if not.
- **Package manager status**: Confirm Homebrew/apt/AUR packages don't exist before marking "Coming Soon".

## Work Package WP04: Setup & Configuration Page - Post-Install (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Create Setup page documenting post-install ergonomics (shell completions, aliases, backend config, tool integrations).
**Independent Test**: User can successfully set up shell completions and configure their preferred backend.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP04-setup-configuration-page.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T020 Create `website/src/pages/setup.astro` with Layout.astro structure

- [ ] T025 Write Environment Variables section (if Caro uses any)
- [ ] T026 Write Tool Integrations section (mise, direnv) with ComingSoonBadge

### Implementation Notes
- Use PlatformTabs for shell-specific examples (bash, zsh, fish)
- If shell completions don't exist, mark section as "Coming Soon"
- Backend config should explain how to switch between MLX/vLLM/Ollama
- Include example configuration files if Caro uses config files
- Tool integrations (mise, direnv) are likely "Coming Soon"

### Parallel Opportunities
- Content sections (T022-T026) can be drafted in parallel after research (T021) completes

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP01 (requires PlatformTabs and ComingSoonBadge components).

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Completion availability**: Research may reveal completions aren't implemented; mark as "Coming Soon" if needed.
- **Config file format**: If config format is unclear, provide examples for most common formats (TOML/YAML/JSON).

- Mobile: Drawer section appears in slide-out menu
- Use icons for visual clarity: 🚀 (Quick Start), 📦 (Installation), ⚙️ (Setup)
- Include brief descriptions for each link

### Parallel Opportunities
- None (single file modification, sequential work).

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP02, WP03, WP04 (pages must exist to link to).

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Navigation JavaScript conflicts**: Test thoroughly in both desktop and mobile views.
- **Dropdown positioning**: Ensure dropdown doesn't overflow viewport or conflict with other elements.

- Test with screen reader (VoiceOver on macOS, NVDA on Windows)

### Parallel Opportunities
- Testing tasks (T032-T036) can be executed in parallel by different testers

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP02, WP03, WP04, WP05 (all pages and navigation must exist).

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Browser-specific bugs**: Test early in multiple browsers; fix issues incrementally.
- **Accessibility failures**: Use existing website as reference for ARIA labels and semantic HTML.
