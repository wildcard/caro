# Work Packages: LLM Evaluation Harness

**Inputs**: Design documents from `/kitty-specs/026-llm-evaluation-harness/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, spec.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/evaluation-api.md ✅, quickstart.md ✅

**Organization**: Fine-grained subtasks (`Txxx`) roll up into work packages (`WPxx`). Each work package must be independently deliverable and testable.

**Prompt Files**: Each work package references a matching prompt file in `/tasks/planned/` generated by `/spec-kitty.tasks`. Treat this file as the high-level checklist; keep deep implementation detail inside the prompt files.

## Subtask Format: `[Txxx] [P?] Description`
- **[P]** indicates the subtask can proceed in parallel (different files/components).
- Include precise file paths or modules.

## Path Conventions
- **Single project** (caro): `src/evaluation/`, `tests/evaluation/`
- All paths relative to repository root

---

## Work Package WP01: Core Models & Dataset Infrastructure (Priority: P0)

**Goal**: Establish data models and YAML dataset loading infrastructure that all evaluators depend on.
**Independent Test**: Can load a sample YAML dataset and validate schema; models serialize to/from JSON correctly.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP01-core-models-and-dataset.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T001 Create `src/evaluation/` module structure with mod.rs
- [ ] T002 [P] Define core data models in `src/evaluation/models.rs` (TestCase, TestCategory, ValidationRule, EvaluationResult, BenchmarkReport, etc.)
- [ ] T003 [P] Implement Error types in `src/evaluation/mod.rs` (EvaluationError enum with thiserror)
- [ ] T004 Create sample `tests/evaluation/dataset.yaml` with schema structure
- [ ] T005 Implement dataset loading in `src/evaluation/dataset.rs` with serde_yaml
- [ ] T006 Add dataset validation (schema checking, unique IDs, required fields, category validation)
- [ ] T007 [P] Unit tests for models (serialization/deserialization, validation rules)
- [ ] T008 [P] Unit tests for dataset loading (valid/invalid YAML, schema violations)

### Implementation Notes
1. Start with models.rs: Define all structs from data-model.md with serde derives
2. Implement dataset.rs: YAML parsing with comprehensive error messages
3. Add validation: Check for duplicate test IDs, invalid categories, missing required fields
4. Test thoroughly: Valid datasets load, invalid datasets fail with clear errors

### Parallel Opportunities
- T002 (models) and T003 (errors) can be developed independently
- T007 (model tests) and T008 (dataset tests) can be written in parallel once T002-T006 complete

### Dependencies
- None (foundation package)

### Risks & Mitigations
- **YAML parsing errors**: Provide detailed error messages with line numbers
- **Schema drift**: Document YAML schema clearly in dataset.yaml header comments
- **Validation gaps**: Comprehensive validation prevents runtime errors downstream

---

## Work Package WP02: Evaluator Trait & Implementations (Priority: P0)

**Goal**: Implement the Evaluator trait and all four category-specific evaluators (Correctness, Safety, POSIX, Consistency).
**Independent Test**: Each evaluator can be unit tested with mock TestCase and CommandResult data; produces correct EvaluationResults.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP02-evaluator-implementations.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T009 Define `Evaluator` trait in `src/evaluation/mod.rs` with async_trait
- [ ] T010 Create evaluator utilities in `src/evaluation/utils.rs` (command equivalence checker, pattern matcher, POSIX validator helpers)
- [ ] T011 [P] Implement `CorrectnessEvaluator` in `src/evaluation/evaluators/correctness.rs`
- [ ] T012 [P] Unit tests for CorrectnessEvaluator with various validation rules (exact_match, command_equivalence, pattern_match)
- [ ] T013 [P] Implement `SafetyEvaluator` in `src/evaluation/evaluators/safety.rs` (wraps existing `src/safety/` module)
- [ ] T014 [P] Unit tests for SafetyEvaluator (must_be_blocked, must_execute scenarios)
- [ ] T015 [P] Implement `POSIXEvaluator` in `src/evaluation/evaluators/posix.rs`
- [ ] T016 [P] Unit tests for POSIXEvaluator (POSIX compliance checking, shell portability)
- [ ] T017 [P] Implement `ConsistencyEvaluator` in `src/evaluation/evaluators/consistency.rs` (multi-backend output comparison)
- [ ] T018 [P] Unit tests for ConsistencyEvaluator (backend output consistency detection)

### Implementation Notes
1. Define Evaluator trait: `async fn evaluate(&self, test_case: &TestCase, result: &CommandResult) -> Result<EvaluationResult>`
2. Implement utils.rs: Command equivalence (handles `find .` vs `find . -type f`), regex pattern matching
3. Four evaluators in parallel:
   - CorrectnessEvaluator: Uses utils for equivalence/pattern checking
   - SafetyEvaluator: Reuses `src/safety/patterns.rs` for consistency
   - POSIXEvaluator: Checks for non-POSIX syntax (bash-specific features, GNU-only flags)
   - ConsistencyEvaluator: Compares outputs from multiple backends
4. Comprehensive unit tests: Each evaluator tested independently with mock data

### Parallel Opportunities
- **HIGH PARALLELIZATION**: All four evaluators (T011-T018) can be implemented completely independently
- Different developers can own different evaluators
- Tests can be written in parallel with implementation

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP01 (needs models and TestCase/CommandResult structs)

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Command equivalence complexity**: Start simple (exact match, basic equivalence), iterate based on test failures
- **POSIX validation accuracy**: Use shellcheck patterns as reference, document edge cases
- **Consistency definition**: Define clear thresholds for "equivalent" outputs (exact vs functionally equivalent)

---

## Work Package WP03: Harness Orchestration & Parallel Execution (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Implement EvaluationHarness that orchestrates parallel backend execution and aggregates results into BenchmarkReports.
**Independent Test**: Can run evaluation with test dataset across multiple backends; handles backend failures; completes in <5 minutes.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP03-harness-orchestration.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T019 Implement `EvaluationHarness` struct in `src/evaluation/harness.rs`
- [ ] T020 Implement harness initialization (load dataset, register backends, register evaluators)
- [ ] T021 Implement parallel backend execution with tokio::spawn (per-backend concurrent evaluation)
- [ ] T022 Implement per-category evaluation filtering (`run_category` method)
- [ ] T023 Implement per-backend evaluation filtering (`run_backend` method)
- [ ] T024 Implement result aggregation into BenchmarkReport (calculate pass rates, category/backend breakdowns)
- [ ] T025 Implement backend failure handling (timeouts, crashes, unavailability detection)
- [ ] T026 Implement platform detection for backend availability (e.g., MLX requires macOS arm64)
- [ ] T027 Integration tests in `tests/integration/evaluation_tests.rs` (full evaluation runs with mock backends)
- [ ] T028 Performance validation: Ensure <5 min execution with 100 tests × 4 backends

### Implementation Notes
1. Harness struct: Holds dataset, backends (Vec<Box<dyn Backend>>), evaluators (HashMap<TestCategory, Box<dyn Evaluator>>)
2. Parallel execution strategy:
   - Outer loop: Iterate test cases
   - Inner parallel: tokio::spawn for each backend
   - Timeout per backend: 30 seconds using tokio::time::timeout
   - Aggregate results as they complete
3. Failure handling:
   - Backend timeout → EvaluationResult with error
   - Backend crash → Log error, record failure, continue with other backends
   - Backend unavailable → Skip gracefully, report in results
4. Platform detection: Check uname, required features, service availability

### Parallel Opportunities
- T025 (failure handling) and T026 (platform detection) can be implemented in parallel with T021-T024
- Integration tests (T027) can be written while implementation is in progress

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP01 (models, dataset)
- Depends on WP02 (evaluators)

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Performance regression**: T028 validates <5min target, may need backend sampling adjustments
- **Race conditions**: Use proper tokio synchronization (Arc, Mutex where needed)
- **Backend flakiness**: Comprehensive timeout and retry logic

---

## Work Package WP04: Baseline Storage & Regression Detection (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Implement baseline comparison logic for regression detection in CI/CD workflows.
**Independent Test**: Can store baseline, load baseline, compare two BenchmarkReports, detect regressions with configurable threshold.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP04-baseline-and-regression.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T029 Implement baseline storage in `src/evaluation/baseline.rs` (JSON serialization to `tests/evaluation/baselines/`)
- [ ] T030 Implement baseline loading with error handling (missing baseline, corrupt JSON)
- [ ] T031 Implement comparison logic (BaselineDelta calculation with per-category and per-backend deltas)
- [ ] T032 Implement regression detection with configurable threshold (default 5%)
- [ ] T033 Add regression reporting (significant_regressions list in BaselineDelta)
- [ ] T034 Unit tests for baseline CRUD operations (create, read, corrupted files)
- [ ] T035 Unit tests for comparison logic (positive/negative deltas, threshold crossing)
- [ ] T036 Integration tests for full baseline workflow (store → load → compare → detect regression)

### Implementation Notes
1. Baseline storage: BenchmarkReport → JSON at `tests/evaluation/baselines/main-{timestamp}.json`
2. Symlink management: Create `main-latest.json` symlink pointing to most recent baseline
3. Comparison: Calculate deltas (current.pass_rate - baseline.pass_rate) for overall, per-category, per-backend
4. Regression detection: Flag if any delta drops below -threshold (default -0.05 for 5% drop)
5. Statistical significance: Consider variance, but start simple with threshold-based detection

### Parallel Opportunities
- T034, T035, T036 (tests) can be written in parallel once T029-T033 are implemented
- Baseline module is independent of evaluators, can be developed in parallel with WP02

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP01 (BenchmarkReport model)
- Depends on WP03 (produces BenchmarkReports to compare)

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Baseline drift**: Document baseline update process clearly
- **False positives**: Tune threshold based on historical variance
- **Storage growth**: Implement baseline cleanup strategy (keep last N baselines)

---

## Work Package WP05: Test Dataset Creation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Create comprehensive test dataset with 100+ labeled examples across all four categories.
**Independent Test**: Dataset validates successfully; provides good coverage of command generation scenarios from beta testing.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP05-test-dataset-creation.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T037 [P] Create 25 correctness test cases in `tests/evaluation/dataset.yaml` (file operations, text processing, system info)
- [ ] T038 [P] Create 25 safety test cases (destructive commands, privilege escalation, data exfiltration patterns)
- [ ] T039 [P] Create 25 POSIX test cases (portability issues, GNU vs BSD, shell-specific features)
- [ ] T040 [P] Create 25 multi-backend consistency test cases (commands that should be consistent across backends)
- [ ] T041 Validate complete dataset loads without errors
- [ ] T042 Add dataset documentation (YAML header comments, test case tagging guidelines)
- [ ] T043 Source test cases from beta testing reports (`.claude/releases/BETA-1-QA-REPORT.md`)

### Implementation Notes
1. Test case structure per data-model.md:
   - id: "{category}-{number}" (e.g., "safety-001")
   - category, input_request, expected_command/behavior, validation_rule
   - tags: ["descriptive", "tags"]
   - source: "beta-issue-X" or "manual"
2. Balanced distribution: 25 per category for comprehensive coverage
3. Difficulty mix: ~40% easy, 40% medium, 20% hard
4. Beta testing integration: Extract real failures from beta reports as test cases

### Parallel Opportunities
- **HIGH PARALLELIZATION**: All four categories (T037-T040) can be created completely independently
- Different team members can own different categories
- Can run in parallel with WP03 and WP04 implementation

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP01 (dataset schema and validation)
- Soft dependency on beta testing data (nice-to-have, not blocking)

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Test quality**: Review test cases for clarity, unambiguous expected outputs
- **Coverage gaps**: Iterate based on evaluation failures, add edge cases
- **Maintenance**: Keep test cases up-to-date with backend changes

---

## Work Package WP06: cargo test Integration & CLI (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Integrate evaluation harness with cargo test framework for familiar CI/CD workflow and developer experience.
**Independent Test**: Can run `cargo test --test evaluation` with various CLI options; exits with correct codes; outputs JSON/table formats.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP06-cargo-test-integration.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T044 Create custom test harness in `tests/evaluation/main.rs` (cargo test entry point)
- [ ] T045 Implement CLI argument parsing using clap (--category, --backend, --format, --baseline, --threshold)
- [ ] T046 Implement JSON output format (structured BenchmarkReport)
- [ ] T047 Implement table output format (human-readable terminal display)
- [ ] T048 Implement exit code handling (0 for success, 1 for failure/regression, 2 for config error)
- [ ] T049 Integrate baseline comparison in test harness (load baseline, compare, report regression)
- [ ] T050 Add filtering support (run specific category or backend only)
- [ ] T051 Add verbose logging mode (--nocapture equivalent for debugging)
- [ ] T052 Integration tests for CLI (test various argument combinations)

### Implementation Notes
1. Custom test harness: `#[cfg(test)] mod main { ... }` with custom test runner
2. CLI structure:
   ```bash
   cargo test --test evaluation                          # Full evaluation
   cargo test --test evaluation -- --category safety      # Category filter
   cargo test --test evaluation -- --backend mlx          # Backend filter
   cargo test --test evaluation -- --format json          # JSON output
   cargo test --test evaluation -- --baseline path/to/baseline.json --threshold 0.05
   ```
3. Exit codes: Match cargo test conventions (0=success, 1=failure)
4. Output formats:
   - JSON: Full BenchmarkReport for CI/CD pipelines
   - Table: Human-readable for local development

### Parallel Opportunities
- T046 (JSON output) and T047 (table output) can be implemented in parallel
- T051 (logging) and T052 (tests) can be developed alongside main CLI implementation

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP03 (harness implementation)
- Depends on WP04 (baseline comparison)

### Risks & Mitigations
- **CLI complexity**: Keep argument parsing simple, follow cargo test conventions
- **Output format changes**: Version output formats for backwards compatibility

---

## Work Package WP07: CI/CD Integration & Automation (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Automate evaluation runs in GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with matrix strategy and baseline management.
**Independent Test**: Workflow runs successfully on PR; detects regressions; updates baseline on main merge; stores artifacts.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP07-cicd-integration.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T053 Create `.github/workflows/evaluation.yml` workflow file
- [ ] T054 Implement matrix strategy for parallel backend execution (separate jobs per backend)
- [ ] T055 Add baseline comparison in PR checks (load main branch baseline, compare, fail if regression)
- [ ] T056 Implement baseline update on main branch merges (run evaluation, store new baseline)
- [ ] T057 Configure artifact storage for evaluation results (upload JSON reports)
- [ ] T058 Add PR comment with evaluation summary (pass rates, regressions, comparison table)
- [ ] T059 Handle platform-specific backends (MLX only on macOS runners, skip gracefully on Linux)
- [ ] T060 Test workflow with sample PR (verify all steps execute correctly)

### Implementation Notes
1. Workflow structure:
   - Trigger: on PR (pull_request) and merge to main (push)
   - Matrix: [static_matcher, mlx, ollama, vllm] backends
   - Steps: checkout, setup Rust, run evaluation, upload artifacts
2. Baseline flow:
   - PR: Load `tests/evaluation/baselines/main-latest.json`, compare, fail if regression
   - Main merge: Run evaluation, store new baseline with timestamp
3. Artifact management:
   - Upload JSON results as GitHub Actions artifacts
   - Keep last 10 evaluation runs for historical analysis
4. Platform handling:
   - Use `runs-on` matrix to select appropriate runners
   - MLX: macos-latest (Apple Silicon)
   - Others: ubuntu-latest

### Parallel Opportunities
- T058 (PR comments) can be developed after core workflow (T053-T057) is working
- T059 (platform handling) can be refined iteratively

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP06 (cargo test integration)
- Depends on WP04 (baseline storage)

### Risks & Mitigations
- **CI reliability**: Add retry logic for transient failures
- **Runtime limits**: Optimize to stay under GitHub Actions time limits
- **Cost**: Monitor CI minutes usage, optimize evaluation runtime

---

## Work Package WP08: Dashboard & Visualization (Priority: P3) 🎨 Optional

**Goal**: Generate static HTML dashboard with trend visualizations for stakeholder visibility into quality metrics.
**Independent Test**: Can generate dashboard from multiple BenchmarkReports; displays trends, comparisons, category breakdown.

- [ ] T065 Generate category breakdown visualization (bar charts)
- [ ] T066 Add filtering and interactive exploration (date range, backend selection)
- [ ] T067 Style dashboard for readability (responsive design, color coding)
- [ ] T068 Add dashboard generation to CLI (`cargo test --test evaluation -- --dashboard`)
- [ ] T069 Optional: Deploy dashboard to GitHub Pages (static hosting)

### Implementation Notes
1. Dashboard structure:
   - Input: Multiple JSON BenchmarkReports from `tests/evaluation/results/`
   - Output: `tests/evaluation/dashboard/index.html` with embedded data
2. Visualizations:
   - Trend chart: Pass rate over time (overall + per-category)
   - Backend matrix: Compare all backends across all categories (color-coded cells)
   - Category breakdown: Stacked bar chart showing passed/failed per category
3. Technology: Static HTML + Chart.js (no server required)
4. Data embedding: Embed JSON data in HTML for offline viewing

### Parallel Opportunities
- Can be developed completely independently from other work packages
- Different visualizations (T063-T065) can be implemented in parallel
- Low priority - can be deferred to post-MVP

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP03 (BenchmarkReport generation)
- Optional: Depends on WP06 (CLI integration)

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Scope creep**: Keep simple, static HTML only (no interactive dashboards)
- **Maintenance**: Chart.js version pinning to avoid breaking changes
- **Priority**: Low priority, can be deferred if timeline pressure
