**Commitment:**
- Full-time founder energy and dedication
- Building in public with transparent roadmap
- Customer-obsessed mindset (solving real developer pain)

**Body:**

```
Hey [Name],

I've been blown away by your contributions to cmdai over the past [timeframe].
You've shipped [specific examples: e.g., "the Kubernetes safety patterns, the
MLX performance optimizations"] and your technical judgment has been excellent.

Here's what I'm thinking: cmdai is positioned to become the AI-native operations
platform for 10,000+ teams (think PostHog for DevOps). We have a working MVP,
clear path to revenue, and a proven business model.

I'm looking for a technical co-founder to build this with me. Not an employee -
a true partner with 20-40% equity who owns the technical vision and builds the
engineering team.

- DevOps/CLI domain expertise
- Roadmap to revenue (open source + cloud + enterprise)
- Founder commitment and execution energy

**The opportunity:**
- PostHog did $40M ARR in 3 years with this model
- GitLab IPO'd at $11B
- We're early in a massive category (AI + DevOps)
- Raising seed round Q1 2025 ($2-5M from top-tier VCs)

I know you're [mention what you know about their situation - employed, doing
other projects, etc.], but I had to ask. Even if the timing isn't right, I'd
love to get your thoughts on the vision.

Want to grab coffee (virtual or IRL) and explore this?

This model works. PostHog did $40M ARR in 3 years. GitLab IPO'd at $11B. Supabase hit $100M ARR in 3 years. All used this exact playbook: open source for growth, cloud/enterprise for revenue.

## Trial Project (1-2 Week Collaboration)

**Purpose:** Work together on a real feature before making the co-founder decision. This is like dating before marriage.

### Why a Trial?

**For you:**
- See their code quality and technical judgment
- Assess collaboration and communication style
- Observe problem-solving approach
- Test cultural fit in real work

**For them:**
- Experience the codebase and technical challenges
- See if they enjoy the work and problem space
- Assess your working relationship
- Evaluate the opportunity hands-on

### Trial Structure

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks (can be part-time if they're still employed)

**Compensation:**
- Option 1: Unpaid (sweat equity if they join)
- Option 2: Pay consulting rate ($200-300/hr) for their time
- Recommended: Option 2 if they need to take time off work

**Commitment:**
- 10-20 hours of focused work
- Daily async updates
- 2-3 pair programming sessions
- Code reviews on each other's work

### Recommended Feature: Cloud API Authentication Foundation

**Why this feature:**
- Core to the cloud platform
- Requires architectural thinking
- Demonstrates security mindedness
- Involves Rust backend work
- Scoped but meaningful

**The task:**

```
Design and implement the authentication foundation for cmdai's cloud API.

Requirements:
1. JWT-based authentication system
2. User registration and login endpoints
3. Token refresh mechanism
4. Rate limiting (prevent abuse)
5. Input validation and security best practices
6. Comprehensive error handling
7. Unit and integration tests

Tech stack:
- Rust + Axum (web framework)
- PostgreSQL (user storage)
- Redis (token storage, rate limiting)

Deliverables:
- Working code with tests
- API documentation (OpenAPI spec)
- Architecture decision record (ADR) explaining design choices
- Security considerations document

Time estimate: 10-20 hours
```

**How to structure it:**

**Week 1:**

**Day 1 (2 hours):**
- Kickoff call: Review requirements together
- Discuss architectural approach
- Align on tech choices
- Set up their dev environment

**Day 2-3 (4-6 hours):**
- They design the system (architecture doc)
- Async review and feedback from you
- Pair programming session (1 hour) to align

**Day 4-5 (4-6 hours):**
- Implementation phase
- They submit code for review
- You review and provide feedback

**Week 2 (if needed):**

**Day 6-7 (2-4 hours):**
- Address review feedback
- Refine implementation
- Add tests and documentation

**Day 8 (1 hour):**
- Final review session
- Retrospective: What went well? What was challenging?
- Discuss learnings and fit

### What to Observe

**Technical:**
- [ ] Code quality (readable, maintainable, idiomatic Rust)
- [ ] Security awareness (input validation, auth best practices)
- [ ] Testing approach (comprehensive, meaningful tests)
- [ ] Documentation quality (clear, thorough)
- [ ] Architectural thinking (good design choices with rationale)

**Collaboration:**
- [ ] Communication style (clear, proactive, responsive)
- [ ] Receptiveness to feedback (non-defensive, iterative)
- [ ] Question-asking (asks good questions when uncertain)
- [ ] Autonomy vs. guidance (can work independently but knows when to ask)

**Cultural:**
- [ ] Excitement about the problem (engaged, interested)
- [ ] Attention to detail (thoroughness, quality-minded)
- [ ] Work style compatibility (async communication, pace)
- [ ] Problem-solving approach (systematic, thoughtful)

### Decision Framework

**After the trial, ask yourself:**

1. **Would I want to work with this person for the next 5 years?**
   - If hesitation, that's your answer

2. **Did they produce high-quality work?**
   - Code quality, tests, documentation all matter

3. **Do they communicate well?**
   - Async updates, clear explanations, responsive

4. **Are they excited about cmdai?**
   - Genuine interest, asked good questions, showed enthusiasm

5. **Do our work styles mesh?**
   - Pace, communication, decision-making all compatible

**If 4+ are "yes" → Strong candidate, move forward**

**If 2-3 are "yes" → Uncertain, consider longer trial or pass**

**If 0-1 are "yes" → Not the right fit**

### Alternative Trial Projects

If authentication doesn't fit, consider these:

**Option 2: Safety Pattern Expansion**
- Add 20 new dangerous command patterns
- Implement pattern testing framework
- Document safety philosophy
- Why: Shows attention to detail, security mindset

**Option 3: MLX Performance Optimization**
- Profile and optimize MLX backend
- Reduce inference latency by 20%
- Document optimization approaches
- Why: Shows systems thinking, performance engineering

**Option 4: Integration System Design**
- Design the plugin/integration architecture
- Implement 2 example integrations (AWS, Kubernetes)
- Write integration developer guide
- Why: Shows API design, extensibility thinking

## Questions?

If you need help with any of this:
- Reviewing your outreach emails before sending
- Vetting a specific candidate
- Negotiating equity splits
- Structuring the trial project

Feel free to ask. Finding the right co-founder is the most important decision
you'll make. Take the time to get it right.

**Remember:** You're not just hiring someone. You're choosing a partner for a
5-7 year journey. Be selective. Be patient. Be honest.

The right co-founder will make this 10x easier. The wrong one will make it impossible.

**Good luck with the search!** 🚀
