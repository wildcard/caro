## 🔑 Key Messages

### Safety First
> "The model lied. It marked `rm -rf /` as safe. Our patterns caught it. This is non-negotiable."

### Working Code
> "We're not showing mockups. We have working code running right now on Apple Silicon."

### Community Governance
> "Safety is too important to be controlled by a single entity."

### Vision
> "That's cmdai. Let's build it together."

## 📈 Model Analysis Results

### Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B (Production Model)

**Performance:**
