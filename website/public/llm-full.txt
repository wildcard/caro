## Overview

Caro is an open-source Rust CLI tool that helps you generate POSIX-compliant shell commands from natural language descriptions. It runs 100% locally by default, validates commands for safety before execution, and supports multiple LLM backends.

### Key Features

- **Privacy-First**: Runs 100% locally - your commands, file paths, and data never leave your machine
- **Safety Validation**: Pattern-based detection of dangerous commands (rm -rf /, fork bombs, disk wipers) before execution
- **Multiple Backends**: Supports Ollama, MLX (Apple Silicon), llama.cpp, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL)
- **POSIX Compliant**: Generates shell-agnostic commands that work everywhere
- **AI Agent Integration**: Available as MCP server for Claude and other AI agents

### Installation

Install via cargo:
```bash
cargo install caro
```

Or use the install script:
```bash
curl -sSL https://caro.sh/install.sh | bash
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate a command from natural language
caro "find all Python files modified in the last week"

# Auto-execute safe commands
caro -e "list files sorted by size"

# Use a specific backend
caro --backend ollama "compress all logs older than 30 days"

# JSON output for scripting
caro --json "find large files"
```

### Configuration

Caro uses a config file at `~/.config/caro/config.toml`:

```toml
# Default backend (ollama, mlx, anthropic, openai)
backend = "ollama"

# Default model for the backend
model = "llama3"

# Safety validation level (strict, normal, permissive)
safety_level = "normal"

# Enable/disable telemetry
telemetry = false
```

### System Requirements

- macOS, Linux, or Windows (WSL)
- Rust 1.70+ for building from source
- 8GB+ RAM recommended for local LLM inference
- Apple Silicon Macs get hardware acceleration with MLX

Q: How can I support Caro

A: Caro is a privacy-first AI shell assistant that converts natural language into safe, validated shell commands. It runs 100% locally on your machine—your commands, file paths, and data never leave your computer.

A: The easiest way is via cargo: cargo install caro. You can also use our install script: bash  (curl --proto 

A: Caro runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL). You need Rust 1.70+ for building from source. For local LLM inference, we recommend 8GB+ RAM. Apple Silicon Macs get hardware acceleration with MLX.

A: It depends on your backend choice. Local backends (Ollama, MLX, llama.cpp) require no API keys. Cloud backends (Anthropic, OpenAI) require API keys. Caro defaults to trying local inference first.

A: Caro uses pattern-based command validation, not AI-based filtering. Every generated command is checked against known dangerous patterns (rm -rf /, fork bombs, disk wipers) before you run it. This is deterministic, not probabilistic—the same command always gets the same safety assessment.

A: Caro shows a clear warning explaining why the command is dangerous and what it would do. You can still proceed if you intend to run it—Caro is a seatbelt, not a straitjacket. For truly destructive commands, you

A: No. Caro runs 100% locally by default. Your commands, file paths, server names, and directory structures never leave your machine. If you choose to use a cloud backend (like Anthropic or OpenAI), only the natural language prompt is sent—not your command history or file system data.

A: Yes—Caro is designed with AI agents in mind. We recommend defense in depth: run agents as unprivileged users, sandbox to specific directories, use container isolation, and let Caro validate commands. Each layer catches what others miss.

A: Safety patterns are baked into the binary. When you update Caro (cargo install caro --force), you get the latest patterns. The core dangerous commands don

A: Caro supports multiple backends: Local: Ollama, MLX (Apple Silicon), llama.cpp. Cloud: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT. Caro automatically selects the best available backend or you can specify one explicitly.

A: For privacy and offline use, choose local backends. On Apple Silicon Macs, MLX offers the best performance with hardware acceleration. Ollama is great cross-platform. For best quality responses, cloud backends like Claude typically perform better but require API keys.

A: Install Ollama from ollama.ai, then run ollama pull llama3 (or another model). Caro will automatically detect Ollama when it

A: MLX is built into Caro for Apple Silicon Macs. Ensure you have the mlx Python package installed. Caro will automatically use MLX when available on M1/M2/M3 Macs for hardware-accelerated local inference.

A: Yes! With Ollama, you can use any GGUF model. With MLX, you can use any MLX-compatible model. Point Caro to your model with the --model flag or set it in your config file.

A: Simply run caro \

A: By default, Caro shows you the command and waits for confirmation. You can use --execute or -e to auto-execute safe commands, but dangerous commands always require explicit confirmation.

A: Caro detects your shell ($SHELL) at runtime and generates appropriate syntax. It works with bash, zsh, fish, and POSIX sh. On macOS, it knows you

A: Yes! Use caro --quiet for scripting. You can pipe output, use in CI/CD, or integrate with other tools. The --output json flag outputs structured data for programmatic use.

A: Caro uses a config file at ~/.config/caro/config.toml. You can set your preferred backend, default model, safety level, and other options. Run caro --help to see all configuration options.

A: This means Caro couldn

A: Local inference speed depends on your hardware and model size. Try a smaller model (7B instead of 70B), use MLX on Apple Silicon for acceleration, or switch to a cloud backend for faster responses.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**What is Caro?**
Caro is a privacy-first AI shell assistant that converts natural language into safe, validated shell commands. It runs 100% locally on your machine - your commands, file paths, and data never leave your computer.

**How do I install Caro?**
The easiest way is via cargo: `cargo install caro`. You can also use the install script: `curl -sSL https://caro.sh/install.sh | bash`. For other options, see our installation guide.

**What are the system requirements?**
Caro runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL). You need Rust 1.70+ for building from source. For local LLM inference, we recommend 8GB+ RAM. Apple Silicon Macs get hardware acceleration with MLX.

**Do I need an API key to use Caro?**
It depends on your backend choice. Local backends (Ollama, MLX, llama.cpp) require no API keys. Cloud backends (Anthropic, OpenAI) require API keys. Caro defaults to trying local inference first.

### Safety & Security

**How does Caro's safety validation work?**
Caro uses pattern-based command validation, not AI-based filtering. Every generated command is checked against known dangerous patterns (rm -rf /, fork bombs, disk wipers) before you run it. This is deterministic, not probabilistic - the same command always gets the same safety assessment.

**What happens when Caro detects a dangerous command?**
Caro shows a clear warning explaining why the command is dangerous and what it would do. You can still proceed if you intend to run it - Caro is a seatbelt, not a straitjacket. For truly destructive commands, you'll need to explicitly confirm.

**Does Caro send my data to the cloud?**
No. Caro runs 100% locally by default. Your commands, file paths, server names, and directory structures never leave your machine. If you choose to use a cloud backend (like Anthropic or OpenAI), only the natural language prompt is sent - not your command history or file system data.

**Is Caro safe to use with AI agents?**
Yes - Caro is designed with AI agents in mind. We recommend defense in depth: run agents as unprivileged users, sandbox to specific directories, use container isolation, and let Caro validate commands. Each layer catches what others miss.

### Backends & Models

**What LLM backends does Caro support?**
Caro supports multiple backends:
- **Local**: Ollama, MLX (Apple Silicon), llama.cpp
- **Cloud**: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT
Caro automatically selects the best available backend or you can specify one explicitly.

**Which backend should I use?**
For privacy and offline use, choose local backends. On Apple Silicon Macs, MLX offers the best performance with hardware acceleration. Ollama is great cross-platform. For best quality responses, cloud backends like Claude typically perform better but require API keys.

**How do I set up Ollama with Caro?**
Install Ollama from ollama.ai, then run `ollama pull llama3` (or another model). Caro will automatically detect Ollama when it's running. You can verify with `caro --backend ollama "list files"`.

**How do I use MLX on my Mac?**
MLX is built into Caro for Apple Silicon Macs. Ensure you have the mlx Python package installed. Caro will automatically use MLX when available on M1/M2/M3 Macs for hardware-accelerated local inference.

**Can I use my own fine-tuned models?**
Yes! With Ollama, you can use any GGUF model. With MLX, you can use any MLX-compatible model. Point Caro to your model with the `--model` flag or set it in your config file.

### Usage & Features

**How do I use Caro?**
Simply run `caro "your request in natural language"`. For example: `caro "find all Python files modified in the last week"`. Caro generates the command, shows it to you with a safety assessment, and asks for confirmation before running.

**Can Caro execute commands automatically?**
By default, Caro shows you the command and waits for confirmation. You can use `--execute` or `-e` to auto-execute safe commands, but dangerous commands always require explicit confirmation.

**How does Caro handle different shells?**
Caro detects your shell ($SHELL) at runtime and generates appropriate syntax. It works with bash, zsh, fish, and POSIX sh. On macOS, it knows you're using BSD tools; on Linux, it adjusts for GNU syntax.

**Can I use Caro in scripts?**
Yes! Use `caro --quiet` for scripting. You can pipe output, use in CI/CD, or integrate with other tools. The `--json` flag outputs structured data for programmatic use.

### Troubleshooting

**Caro says 'no backend available' - what do I do?**
This means Caro couldn't find a local LLM or API key. Either: (1) Install and start Ollama with a model, (2) Set up MLX if on Apple Silicon, or (3) Set an API key for a cloud provider with `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...`.

**Commands are generating slowly - how do I speed things up?**
Local inference speed depends on your hardware and model size. Try a smaller model (7B instead of 70B), use MLX on Apple Silicon for acceleration, or switch to a cloud backend for faster responses.

**The generated command is wrong - what should I do?**
You can: (1) Rephrase your request to be more specific, (2) Add context like "on macOS" or "using find command", (3) Try a different backend/model, or (4) Report the issue on GitHub so we can improve.

**How do I report a bug or request a feature?**
Open an issue on our GitHub repository at github.com/wildcard/caro/issues. Include your OS, Caro version (`caro --version`), backend, and steps to reproduce.

### Privacy & Telemetry

**What data does Caro collect?**
By default, Caro collects minimal, anonymous usage metrics to help us improve the product - things like command success rates and which backends are used. No commands, file paths, or personal data are ever collected.

**Can I disable telemetry?**
Yes. Set `telemetry = false` in your config file or use `export CARO_TELEMETRY=false`. Caro will work exactly the same with telemetry disabled.

**Is Caro GDPR compliant?**
Yes. We don't collect personal data. All telemetry is anonymous and aggregated. You have full control over what data is sent (if any), and can disable telemetry entirely.

### Contributing & Community

**How can I contribute to Caro?**
We welcome contributions! You can: submit bug reports, propose features, contribute code (it's Rust!), add safety patterns, improve documentation, or help with translations. See our contributing guide on GitHub.

**Is Caro open source?**
Yes! Caro is licensed under AGPL-3.0. You can read, modify, and distribute the source code. The full codebase is available on GitHub.
