# Caro

> Your loyal shell companion - A privacy-first AI CLI assistant that converts natural language to safe shell commands

Caro is an open-source Rust CLI tool that helps you generate POSIX-compliant shell commands from natural language descriptions. It runs 100% locally, validates commands for safety before execution, and supports multiple LLM backends including Ollama, MLX (Apple Silicon), and cloud providers.

## Quick Start

Install via cargo:
```bash
cargo install caro
```

Or use the install script:
```bash
curl -sSL https://caro.sh/install.sh | bash
```

Basic usage:
```bash
caro "find all Python files modified in the last week"
```

## Key Features

- **Privacy-First**: Runs 100% locally - commands never leave your machine
- **Safety Validation**: Pattern-based detection of dangerous commands before execution
- **Multiple Backends**: Supports Ollama, MLX, llama.cpp, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL)
- **POSIX Compliant**: Generates shell-agnostic commands that work everywhere
