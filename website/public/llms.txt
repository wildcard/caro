# Caro - Your Loyal Shell Companion
# https://caro.sh
# LLM-friendly documentation for AI assistants and agents

> Caro is a companion agent that converts natural language to safe POSIX shell commands.

## Overview

Caro helps developers and terminal users by:
- Converting plain English descriptions to shell commands
- Providing safety validation for dangerous operations
- Integrating with Claude as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
- Available as a dedicated Skill for quick access in Claude Code

## Key Features

1. **Natural Language Processing**: Describe what you want in plain English
2. **Safety First**: Validates commands before execution, blocks dangerous patterns
3. **POSIX Compliant**: Generates portable commands that work across Unix systems
4. **Multiple Modes**: Use as MCP server or direct Skill integration

## Installation

### Via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
```bash
brew install wildcard/tap/caro
```

### Via npm (for Claude Desktop MCP)
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic/caro
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wildcard/caro
cd caro
cargo build --release
```

## Usage Examples

Ask Caro in natural language:

| Request | Generated Command |
|---------|-------------------|
| "find all Python files modified today" | `find . -name "*.py" -mtime 0` |
| "compress this folder into a tarball" | `tar -czvf archive.tar.gz .` |
| "show disk usage sorted by size" | `du -sh * \| sort -h` |
| "kill the process using port 3000" | `lsof -ti:3000 \| xargs kill` |
| "count lines in all JavaScript files" | `find . -name "*.js" -exec wc -l {} +` |

## Integration with Claude

### MCP Server Mode (Claude Desktop)

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "caro": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/caro"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Skill Mode (Claude Code)

Access directly in Claude Code terminal sessions. Caro automatically provides shell command assistance when working in terminal contexts.

## Safety Features

Caro validates all generated commands for safety:

### Blocked Patterns
- Filesystem destruction: `rm -rf /`, `rm -rf ~`
- Disk operations: `mkfs`, `dd if=/dev/zero`
- Fork bombs and resource exhaustion
- System path modifications
- Privilege escalation attempts

### Risk Assessment
Commands are categorized by risk level:
- **Safe**: Standard read operations, file listing
- **Moderate**: Write operations, file modifications
- **High**: System changes, permission modifications
- **Critical**: Blocked automatically

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Rust
- **Platforms**: macOS (Apple Silicon optimized), Linux
- **License**: MIT
- **Performance**: < 100ms startup, < 2s inference
