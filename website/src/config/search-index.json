          "Caro is the digitalization of Kyaro (Kyarorain Kadosh), a Shiba Inu who has been living and breathing technology from day one. Born in 2020 during the midst of the COVID pandemic, Kyaro came into this world as a tiny puppy destined to become an office dog. She was brought home by what might be Israel's most workaholic software engineer—though perhaps I'm giving myself too much credit.",
          "From her earliest days, Kyaro was a fixture in the office, visiting multiple days a week. She fell in love with Wix and its office spaces—first at Wix Academy, then at the Tel Aviv port location, later at Namaal, and finally at Wix HQ. But more importantly, she fell in love with the people: the geeks, the developers, the system administrators, and everyone in IT.",
          "Kyaro was always the most friendly dog when it came to technical people. She follows in her owner's pawprints—I've always liked IT folks too, and my friendship with IT departments across every company I've worked for can attest to that. Same goes for Kyaro: she was universally adored by IT people.",
          "Here's the funny thing about Kyaro: most dogs are friendly, but she's socially selective. She doesn't warm up to every dog she meets, and she's certainly not interested in playing with just any pup. I always thought she was into every Shiba Inu, mirroring my own appreciation for the breed. But after moving to Canada, I learned the truth—she's not into every dog, not even every Shiba.",
          "Yet when it comes to humans, especially technical people, programmers, and IT professionals—you name it—Kyaro has always loved them. All of them. Every system department at Wix, all the developers, the DBAs especially—nobody liked her more than the database administrators at Wix. She was their best friend, and they were hers.",
          "When Kyaro wasn't being an office dog, she was always by my side. And what do I do all day, every day? I'm on the computer—developing something, troubleshooting something, building something. She had to cope with that reality, and she did so with grace.",
          "Some might say it's a good life, others might disagree. It's the only life I could give her, and I tried my best. But one thing is certain: Kyaro was universally loved by IT people, sysadmins, front-end engineers, back-end engineers, database administrators—everyone doing software work.",
          "When my spouse was working in the office, we'd take Kyaro along, and she loved it. Everyone there loved her too. I can't speak to whether the IT people at my spouse's office were as smitten with her, but from my experience, she's always had a thing for geeks.",
          "So it's only fitting that she'll be there with developers when they're working side-by-side in their terminals—keeping an eye on them, making sure they're not making mistakes, keeping them safe, giving them sound advice, and fetching those commands."
