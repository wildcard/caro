This goes far beyond detecting your OS and shell. Caro's roadmap includes: Why does Claude Code feel magical when you throw basic requests at it? It's not just the model—it's the prompt engineering and context collection working together. Claude Code runs on the best models possible with the most comprehensive prompting.

This context awareness transforms a good model into an exceptional tool. Caro applies the same philosophy to shell commands. But since most Caro installations will run on smaller, less sophisticated models, we compensate through: \"Batteries included\" means Caro ships not just with models, but with the deterministic tools and context-gathering systems that make those models work brilliantly—even at smaller scales. Caro isn't just about running inference on a language model. She's about running an entire ecosystem of tools that work together: This tooling ecosystem is what allows smaller models to compete with larger ones for the specific task of command generation. We're not trying to build AGI—we're building a highly specialized tool that knows how to compensate for model limitations through better engineering. For users with more powerful hardware or specific use cases, Caro supports larger models that can leverage advanced capabilities: This is the same pattern you see in modern AI coding assistants like Claude Code , Cursor , and Crush by Charm . These tools don't just generate code—they think, plan, and use tools to improve their outputs. Caro is designed to support this evolution. As models improve and hardware becomes more capable, Caro will adapt—automatically selecting backends and techniques that match your system's capabilities. The key principle : You shouldn't need to understand any of this. Caro figures it out for you. For Caro's ideal customer profile (ICP), the \"batteries included\" philosophy isn't just about convenience—it's about trust and control. These are developers who: For these users, shipping complexity to a remote API isn't \"simple\"—it's a non-starter. They need local execution, but they shouldn't need a PhD in machine learning to get it. That's the gap Caro fills. \"Batteries included\" also means Caro isn't a demo you download from the internet and need to tinker with to make useful. It should work from the first command you run. Does this mean it's perfect? Of course not. There will be bugs. There will be edge cases. There will be models that could work better for specific tasks. But that's precisely why we've released Caro as open source—so the community can experiment, provide feedback, and help us improve. The difference is the starting point. You're not beginning with a bare framework you need to configure. You're beginning with a working tool that gets better over time. As Caro evolves, we're committed to maintaining the \"batteries included\" philosophy: The goal remains the same: just install and run . Everything else should be automatic. Try Caro today and experience what \"batteries included\" means for local AI. No expertise required, no remote dependencies, no compromises. That's it. No API keys to configure. No models to download manually. No inference servers to set up. Just Caro, ready to help. We want to extend our deepest gratitude to the Qwen team for creating and open-sourcing the Qwen 2.5 Coder models. Your work makes projects like Caro possible, enabling developers worldwide to benefit from state-of-the-art AI without sacrificing privacy, control, or simplicity. The open-source AI community thrives because teams like yours share not just code, but the careful engineering and research that makes these models genuinely useful at every scale.

Adaptive by default : Caro detects your hardware (Apple Silicon, x86 CPU, CUDA GPU) and automatically uses the optimal backend and model for your system. The goal is simple: should be all it takes to get a working, intelligent command-line assistant. Not a toy demo—a real tool that understands your intent and keeps you safe. The Magic: Qwen 2.5 Coder Models Behind Caro's \"batteries included\" experience is a phenomenal piece of technology from the Qwen team at Alibaba Cloud : the Qwen 2.5 Coder models . These models are special for what we're trying to achieve with Caro. They're: Efficient at small scales : The 1.5B parameter variant runs fast on modest hardware—under 2 seconds for first inference on an M1 Mac. Powerful at larger scales : The 7B and 14B variants provide significantly better reasoning when you have the resources. Purpose-built for code : Trained specifically for programming tasks, including understanding natural language instructions and generating correct code. Open and accessible : Released under permissive licenses, enabling local deployment without API costs or privacy concerns. We want to give massive props to the Qwen team for making these models available to the community. It's rare to find models that perform this well at smaller scales while scaling gracefully to larger sizes. This flexibility is exactly what \"batteries included\" needs—the right model for your hardware, automatically. Why Smaller Models Work for Caro Here's a secret: you don't need frontier-scale models for command generation if you give them the right help. What does \"the right help\" mean? Clear intent : Understanding what the user actually wants to accomplish Platform context : Knowing the OS, architecture, available commands, and shell environment Iteration : Refining commands through multiple passes when needed Safety constraints : Clear boundaries about what's allowed and what isn't Caro's agentic context loop provides this help. We don't just throw your prompt at a model and hope for the best. We collect system information, refine the request through iterative passes, and validate outputs for safety and correctness. This is why Qwen 2.5 Coder 1.5B can punch above its weight class. It's not just the model—it's the model plus the right scaffolding. Caro's Mission: Knowing Everything About Your Environment Here's the deeper truth about \"batteries included\" for Caro: it's not just about shipping with a model. It's about shipping with an entire ecosystem designed around one core mission statement: Caro's mission is to know everything that needs to be known about her user in order to best accommodate their needs. This goes far beyond detecting your OS and shell. Caro's roadmap includes: Vector-based tool documentation : Building a local vector database of your installed tools, distribution-specific utilities, and their usage patterns to provide the model with the right context and reduce hallucination Environment fingerprinting : Understanding not just what tools you have, but how they're configured, what versions you're running, and what patterns you use Iterative refinement : Multiple passes to collect data, validate assumptions, and improve command generation Dry runs and sandboxing : Testing commands in safe environments before presenting them to you The Claude Code Secret: Comprehensive Context Why does Claude Code feel magical when you throw basic requests at it? It's not just the model—it's the prompt engineering and context collection working together. Claude Code runs on the best models possible with the most comprehensive prompting. It knows how to collect data on your project, pick up on patterns in your codebase, and understand where different types of information live. This context awareness transforms a good model into an exceptional tool. Caro applies the same philosophy to shell commands. But since most Caro installations will run on smaller, less sophisticated models, we compensate through: Better context collection : More comprehensive system information, tool availability, and environment understanding Deterministic safety tools : Pattern-based validation that doesn't rely on the model to catch dangerous operations Iterative improvement : Multiple refinement passes to gather feedback and optimize outputs Smart prompting : Crafting prompts that guide smaller models toward correct, safe, platform-specific commands \"Batteries included\" means Caro ships not just with models, but with the deterministic tools and context-gathering systems that make those models work brilliantly—even at smaller scales. Beyond Model Inference: The Tooling Ecosystem Caro isn't just about running inference on a language model. She's about running an entire ecosystem of tools that work together: Safety validators : Deterministic pattern matching that catches dangerous commands regardless of model output POSIX compliance checkers : Ensuring generated commands work across different Unix-like systems Context collectors : Gathering system information, available commands, and environment variables Prompt optimizers : Crafting the right prompts based on what information we've collected Execution validators : Dry runs and sandboxed testing before presenting commands to users This tooling ecosystem is what allows smaller models to compete with larger ones for the specific task of command generation. We're not trying to build AGI—we're building a highly specialized tool that knows how to compensate for model limitations through better engineering. The Frontier: Thinking, Reasoning, and Tool Calling For users with more powerful hardware or specific use cases, Caro supports larger models that can leverage advanced capabilities: Chain-of-thought reasoning : Models that explain their logic before generating commands Tool calling : Models that can check documentation, validate syntax, or gather additional context Multi-step planning : Breaking complex tasks into sequences of safe, validated commands This is the same pattern you see in modern AI coding assistants like Claude Code , Cursor , and Crush by Charm . These tools don't just generate code—they think, plan, and use tools to improve their outputs. Caro is designed to support this evolution. As models improve and hardware becomes more capable, Caro will adapt—automatically selecting backends and techniques that match your system's capabilities. The key principle : You shouldn't need to understand any of this. Caro figures it out for you. Why This Matters: Trust and Control For Caro's ideal customer profile (ICP), the \"batteries included\" philosophy isn't just about convenience—it's about trust and control. These are developers who: Work with sensitive codebases or infrastructure Need compliance with data residency requirements Want to understand and audit their tools Prefer local-first workflows Don't want to pay per-token for basic shell commands For these users, shipping complexity to a remote API isn't \"simple\"—it's a non-starter. They need local execution, but they shouldn't need a PhD in machine learning to get it. That's the gap Caro fills. Not a Toy: A Real Tool from Day One \"Batteries included\" also means Caro isn't a demo you download from the internet and need to tinker with to make useful. It should work from the first command you run. Does this mean it's perfect? Of course not. There will be bugs. There will be edge cases. There will be models that could work better for specific tasks. But that's precisely why we've released Caro as open source—so the community can experiment, provide feedback, and help us improve. The difference is the starting point. You're not beginning with a bare framework you need to configure. You're beginning with a working tool that gets better over time. The Road Ahead As Caro evolves, we're committed to maintaining the \"batteries included\" philosophy: Smarter hardware detection : Better automatic backend selection based on available resources Model updates : Shipping new versions of Qwen and other high-quality local models as they become available Graceful degradation : Using larger models when available, falling back to smaller ones when needed Zero-config optimization : Automatic quantization, caching, and performance tuning The goal remains the same: just install and run . Everything else should be automatic. Try Caro today and experience what \"batteries included\" means for local AI. No expertise required, no remote dependencies, no compromises. Try It Yourself That's it. No API keys to configure. No models to download manually. No inference servers to set up. Just Caro, ready to help. Thank You, Qwen Team We want to extend our deepest gratitude to the Qwen team for creating and open-sourcing the Qwen 2.5 Coder models.

Caro doesn't just give you fish—it teaches you to fish. Every command comes with explanation, safety context, and alternatives when needed. With 52 pre-compiled dangerous command patterns and comprehensive risk assessment, Caro prevents catastrophic mistakes while teaching you to recognize risks independently. No context-switching, no separate tools. Ask Claude a shell question, and Caro's skill activates automatically. It's like having a safety-conscious sysadmin looking over your shoulder. In a world of bash-isms and GNU-specific flags, Caro champions portable, standard-compliant commands that work everywhere. You: \"Delete all .log files older than 30 days\" Caro skill activates and provides: You: \"Show me the top 10 processes by memory usage\" Caro skill provides: You: \"How do I clean up my root directory?\" Caro skill responds: The Caro skill comes with comprehensive documentation: All of this is automatically available to Claude when the skill activates, so you get expert-level guidance without memorizing patterns or reading docs. Ready to bring Caro into your Claude Code workflow? Then just ask Claude any shell question. Caro will be there, ready to help—with safety, education, and POSIX compliance at the forefront. Pro tip: Try asking \"explain the difference between POSIX and bash commands\" to see Caro's educational side in action. This is just the beginning. We're exploring: Caro started as a CLI tool.

          "There's a quiet revolution happening in the terminal. The venerable Unix tools we've relied on for decades— , , , —are being lovingly reimagined by a new generation of developers. Written primarily in Rust and Go, these modern alternatives keep the spirit of their ancestors while bringing performance, safety, and developer experience into the 2020s.",
          "This isn't about replacing Unix philosophy—it's about honoring it with modern engineering. These tools embrace the same principles: do one thing well, work with text streams, and compose beautifully with pipes. They just do it faster, safer, and with sensible defaults.",
          "Rust has become the language of choice for this renaissance, and for good reason. Its ownership model eliminates entire classes of bugs that have plagued C programs for decades. Buffer overflows, use-after-free, data races—Rust prevents them at compile time. For tools that run millions of times a day on production systems, this reliability is invaluable.",
          "But it's not just about safety. Rust compiles to native code that rivals C in performance. Many of these modern tools actually outperform their predecessors, sometimes dramatically.

vulnerabilities in rust crates. we also use cargo-deny for additional checks on licenses, duplicate dependencies, and source trust validation. security advisories and private reporting github's security advisories feature allows security researchers to report vulnerabilities privately. we document our full vulnerability disclosure process in our security.md file. our response commitments: 48 hours : acknowledgment of report 7 days : initial assessment and severity classification 30 days : target fix for critical vulnerabilities 90 days : target fix for moderate vulnerabilities application-level security safety validation: 52+ dangerous patterns caro's safety module is the heart of our security model. before any command is presented to the user, it passes through our pattern-based validator that checks for: filesystem destruction : , , fork bombs : and variants privilege escalation : , system path tampering : operations on , , device manipulation : direct writes to block devices commands are classified into risk levels: safe , moderate , high , and critical . high-risk commands require explicit confirmation, and critical commands are blocked entirely unless the user opts in with . a real-world lesson: while writing this very blog post, we encountered an unexpected deployment failure. including a fork bomb example in the documentation caused our astro build to fail—the parser interpreted the shell syntax as javascript expressions. this incident reinforced an important lesson: even documenting dangerous commands requires careful handling. security awareness must extend beyond runtime validation to every layer of our toolchain. you can see the resolving pr for details. defense in depth we don't rely on a single security control. our defense-in-depth strategy includes: input sanitization : prompts are validated before reaching the model output validation : generated commands are checked against safety patterns user confirmation : commands require explicit approval before execution fail-safe defaults : dangerous operations are blocked by default least privilege : we never encourage running as root development practices ci/cd security pipeline every commit to caro runs through our comprehensive ci pipeline: clippy linting with to catch common mistakes cargo-audit for dependency vulnerabilities cargo-deny for license compliance dependency review for prs touching dependencies cross-platform testing on linux, macos, and windows code review standards all changes to security-sensitive code (safety validation, command execution, model interaction) receive extra scrutiny: security-focused review checklist property-based testing with proptest for edge cases integration tests covering execution paths manual security testing before releases minimal dependencies every dependency is an attack surface. we consciously minimize our dependency tree, carefully evaluate new dependencies, and prefer well-maintained crates with strong security track records. dependencies are pinned in for reproducible builds. community and transparency security hall of fame we maintain a security hall of fame in our security.md to recognize researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. contributors receive: public acknowledgment in security advisories credit in release notes listing in the hall of fame open development security through obscurity doesn't work. our entire codebase, including the safety validation patterns, is open source. this transparency allows: community review of security implementations external security audits contributions to improve our safety patterns trust through verifiability best practices for users while we build security into caro, users play a role too: always review generated commands before execution never use mode for destructive operations keep caro updated for the latest security fixes limit to specific, understood cases report suspicious behavior through our security advisory process looking ahead security is an ongoing journey, not a destination. we're continuously improving: expanding safety patterns based on community feedback enhancing model output validation for edge cases exploring sandboxed execution for high-risk environments regular security audits as the project matures security is a community effort. if you find a vulnerability, please report it through our github security advisories . together, we can keep caro safe for everyone. resources security.md - full security policy and vulnerability reporting github security tab - report

of revolutionary work. the shell you're using, the compiler that built caro, the kernel running your system—all of it traces back to a radical idea: that software should be free. not free as in price, but free as in freedom. we believe that the best tools respect their users. that philosophy didn't originate with us—it came from the gnu project, the free software foundation, and communities like freebsd who proved that openness and excellence aren't opposites. in 1983, richard stallman launched the gnu project with an audacious goal: create a complete, free operating system. the free software foundation, founded in 1985, gave that vision institutional backing. they didn't just write code—they articulated why software freedom matters. the four essential freedoms they defined aren't abstract principles. they're practical guarantees: these freedoms matter especially for ai tools. when software can generate and execute commands on your system, you need to trust it. that trust is built through transparency—the ability to inspect, verify, and modify the code yourself. parallel to gnu, the berkeley software distribution created another pillar of free software. freebsd and its siblings carried forward the unix tradition with a different license philosophy but the same commitment to openness. freebsd's influence is everywhere. the network stack in your router, the kernel in your playstation, the foundation of macos—all trace lineage to bsd. their engineering rigor and \"do one thing well\" philosophy shaped how we think about system software. when we built caro's safety validation system, we drew on bsd's tradition of careful, defensive programming. when we designed our command generation, we honored the unix philosophy of composable tools. these aren't just technical choices—they're cultural inheritances. as ai becomes more capable, the free software principles become more urgent, not less. consider what an ai command-line tool does: it interprets your intent and translates it into system actions. that's an enormous amount of trust to place in software. closed-source ai tools are black boxes. you can't see how they make decisions. you can't verify they're not logging your commands. you can't modify them to respect your privacy preferences. you're dependent on a company's continued goodwill. caro is licensed under agpl-3.0—one of the strongest copyleft licenses available. this isn't accidental. we believe ai tools should be auditable, modifiable, and community-controlled. when you use caro, you're not just a user; you're a potential contributor to a shared resource. our commitment to local-first ai isn't just about privacy or performance—it's about freedom. when models run on your machine, you control them. no api keys to revoke. no usage limits to hit. no terms of service to violate. the fsf has been warning about \"software as a service substitute\" (saass) for years—the way cloud services can strip away the freedoms you'd have with local software. by shipping caro with local inference capabilities, we're applying those lessons to the ai era. we're not claiming to be heroes. the real heroes are the maintainers of gcc and clang, the freebsd port maintainers, the documentation writers, the bug reporters—the vast community that keeps free software alive. what we can do is acknowledge our debts and try to pay them forward: to the gnu project : thank you for gcc, for bash, for emacs, for the audacity to imagine a free operating system and the persistence to build it. to the free software foundation : thank you for defining what software freedom means and defending it when it's inconvenient. to freebsd and the bsd community: thank you for proving that permissive licenses can still build thriving communities, and for engineering excellence that continues to inspire. to every contributor who has written a line of free software, filed a bug, answered a question, or simply used and shared these tools: you're part of something remarkable. caro exists because thousands of people believed that software should serve its users, not the other way around. we're honored to continue that tradition. want to learn more about free software? here are some starting points: the best way to honor free software is to use it, contribute to it, and help others understand why it matters. we hope caro can be one small

          "Why Caro? What makes Caro so special that she deserves to live forever in your terminal? Why should she be digitized for eternity as a command-line tool that runs alongside you every day? The answer lies in the extraordinary story of Kyaro —a very special dog.",
          "Caro is the digitalization of Kyaro (Kyarorain Kadosh), a Shiba Inu who has been living and breathing technology from day one. Born in 2020 during the midst of the COVID pandemic, Kyaro came into this world as a tiny puppy destined to become an office dog. She was brought home by what might be Israel's most workaholic software engineer—though perhaps I'm giving myself too much credit.",
          "From her earliest days, Kyaro was a fixture in the office, visiting multiple days a week. She fell in love with Wix and its office spaces—first at Wix Academy, then at the Tel Aviv port location, later at Namaal, and finally at Wix HQ. But more importantly, she fell in love with the people: the geeks, the developers, the system administrators, and everyone in IT.",
          "Kyaro was always the most friendly dog when it came to technical people. She follows in her owner's pawprints—I've always liked IT folks too, and my friendship with IT departments across every company I've worked for can attest to that. Same goes for Kyaro: she was universally adored by IT people.",
          "Here's the funny thing about Kyaro: most dogs are friendly, but she's socially selective. She doesn't warm up to every dog she meets, and she's certainly not interested in playing with just any pup. I always thought she was into every Shiba Inu, mirroring my own appreciation for the breed. But after moving to Canada, I learned the truth—she's not into every dog, not even every Shiba.",
          "Yet when it comes to humans, especially technical people, programmers, and IT professionals—you name it—Kyaro has always loved them. All of them. Every system department at Wix, all the developers, the DBAs especially—nobody liked her more than the database administrators at Wix. She was their best friend, and they were hers.",
          "When Kyaro wasn't being an office dog, she was always by my side. And what do I do all day, every day? I'm on the computer—developing something, troubleshooting something, building something. She had to cope with that reality, and she did so with grace.",
          "Some might say it's a good life, others might disagree. It's the only life I could give her, and I tried my best. But one thing is certain: Kyaro was universally loved by IT people, sysadmins, front-end engineers, back-end engineers, database administrators—everyone doing software work.",
          "When my spouse was working in the office, we'd take Kyaro along, and she loved it. Everyone there loved her too. I can't speak to whether the IT people at my spouse's office were as smitten with her, but from my experience, she's always had a thing for geeks.",
          "So it's only fitting that she'll be there with developers when they're working side-by-side in their terminals—keeping an eye on them, making sure they're not making mistakes, keeping them safe, giving them sound advice, and fetching those commands.",
          "Here's a fun fact about Shibas: they're not retrievers. You can play fetch with them, but they won't just give it back. You throw it, they might get it, but then you need to work for it. It's part of the logic behind Caro in the terminal—she behaves like a Shiba. She'll put you to some work, and she has Easter eggs you'll discover along the way.",
          "Give her a try. She's definitely here to help you fetch those models and run inference in Rust, in the fastest way possible. You know she's got the zoomies and just can't wait for you to discover the zoomies in your terminal!",
          "This is the story of Kyaro (the IRL Shiba) becoming Caro (the terminal companion). Like Portal 2's Caroline , who was transformed into GLaDOS to become the eternal guardian of Aperture Science's testing chambers, Kyaro becomes Caro—your eternal companion for the terminal. If you're not familiar with the Portal series by Valve , it's a story about loyalty, transformation, and eternal companionship that deeply resonates with Caro's journey.",
          "She's not just a tool. She's not just a CLI. She's a companion with a story, with personality, with a lifetime of love for the people who build technology. She's here to keep you safe, help you work faster, and remind you that even in the most technical of work, there's room for loyalty, warmth, and a little bit of that Shiba sass.",
          "Caro should be in your terminal because she represents something deeper than just another developer tool. She embodies the spirit of companionship in solitary work, the safety that comes from having someone watching your back, and the joy of working alongside someone who understands you.",
          "Every developer who's ever had a pet nearby while coding knows that feeling—the comfort of a loyal presence, the occasional distraction that's actually welcome, the reminder that there's a world beyond the screen. Caro brings that same energy to your command line.",
          "She's been trained by her life among developers. She knows the patterns, the dangers, the workflows. She's watched countless hours of terminal work, witnessed the mistakes, celebrated the victories. Now, she's ready to be your companion too.",
          "Welcome to the pack. Caro is here to stay—in your terminal, by your side, keeping you safe and helping you fetch the perfect commands. Just like a good Shiba, she'll make you work for it, but she'll always have your back.",

Every system department at Wix, all the developers, the DBAs especially—nobody liked her more than the database administrators at Wix. She was their best friend, and they were hers. A Life Lived Side-by-Side with Code When Kyaro wasn't being an office dog, she was always by my side. And what do I do all day, every day? I'm on the computer—developing something, troubleshooting something, building something. She had to cope with that reality, and she did so with grace. Some might say it's a good life, others might disagree. It's the only life I could give her, and I tried my best. But one thing is certain: Kyaro was universally loved by IT people, sysadmins, front-end engineers, back-end engineers, database administrators—everyone doing software work. The DBAs at Wix had a special bond with her. I don't know about other workplaces because she only worked with me in the office at Wix. Since 2023, I've been working remotely from Canada, so she hasn't been going to the office much. It's one of the things I'm a bit sad about—she really liked going to the office. When my spouse was working in the office, we'd take Kyaro along, and she loved it. Everyone there loved her too. I can't speak to whether the IT people at my spouse's office were as smitten with her, but from my experience, she's always had a thing for geeks. The Perfect Terminal Companion So it's only fitting that she'll be there with developers when they're working side-by-side in their terminals—keeping an eye on them, making sure they're not making mistakes, keeping them safe, giving them sound advice, and fetching those commands. Here's a fun fact about Shibas: they're not retrievers. You can play fetch with them, but they won't just give it back. You throw it, they might get it, but then you need to work for it. It's part of the logic behind Caro in the terminal—she behaves like a Shiba. She'll put you to some work, and she has Easter eggs you'll discover along the way. Give her a try. She's definitely here to help you fetch those models and run inference in Rust, in the fastest way possible. You know she's got the zoomies and just can't wait for you to discover the zoomies in your terminal! From Kyaro to Caro This is the story of Kyaro (the IRL Shiba) becoming Caro (the terminal companion). Like Portal 2's Caroline , who was transformed into GLaDOS to become the eternal guardian of Aperture Science's testing chambers, Kyaro becomes Caro—your eternal companion for the terminal. If you're not familiar with the Portal series by Valve , it's a story about loyalty, transformation, and eternal companionship that deeply resonates with Caro's journey. She's not just a tool. She's not just a CLI. She's a companion with a story, with personality, with a lifetime of love for the people who build technology. She's here to keep you safe, help you work faster, and remind you that even in the most technical of work, there's room for loyalty, warmth, and a little bit of that Shiba sass. Why She Belongs in Your Terminal Caro should be in your terminal because she represents something deeper than just another developer tool. She embodies the spirit of companionship in solitary work, the safety that comes from having someone watching your back, and the joy of working alongside someone who understands you. Every developer who's ever had a pet nearby while coding knows that feeling—the comfort of a loyal presence, the occasional distraction that's actually welcome, the reminder that there's a world beyond the screen. Caro brings that same energy to your command line. She's been trained by her life among developers. She knows the patterns, the dangers, the workflows. She's watched countless hours of terminal work, witnessed the mistakes, celebrated the victories. Now, she's ready to be your companion too. Welcome to the pack. Caro is here to stay—in your terminal, by your side, keeping you safe and helping you fetch the perfect commands. Just like a good Shiba, she'll make you work for it, but she'll always have your back.

While GitHub has privacy policies in place, your shell commands - including potentially sensitive paths, server names, and operations - traverse the internet. Caro runs entirely on your machine. With local model inference, your commands, prompts, and terminal context never leave your computer. This makes Caro suitable for air-gapped environments, compliance-restricted organizations, and developers who simply prefer to keep their terminal activity private. GitHub Copilot CLI relies on the underlying language model to generate \"safe\" suggestions. There's no systematic validation layer - the model might or might not catch dangerous patterns like . Caro has 52+ predefined safety patterns that validate every command before presenting it to you. Dangerous operations like recursive deletions, fork bombs, and system-breaking commands are blocked at the validation layer - independent of what the model suggests.

Caro is completely free and open source. You run it on your hardware with your own models. No accounts, no subscriptions, no vendor lock-in. GitHub Copilot CLI has access to powerful OpenAI models (GPT-4 class) trained on massive datasets. For complex, novel commands, it may produce better suggestions. Caro uses local models which, while improving rapidly, may not match the raw capability of cloud giants.

      "fullText": "FAQ - Caro Shell Assistant Frequently asked questions about Caro, the privacy-first AI shell assistant. Learn about installation, safety features, backends, usage, and more. Frequently asked questions about Caro questions help support installation usage safety backends =https Getting Started rocket What is Caro? Caro is a privacy-first AI shell assistant that converts natural language into safe, validated shell commands. It runs 100% locally on your machine—your commands, file paths, and data never leave your computer. How do I install Caro? What are the system requirements? Do I need an API key to use Caro? It depends on your backend choice. Local backends (Ollama, MLX, llama.cpp) require no API keys. Cloud backends (Anthropic, OpenAI) require API keys. Caro defaults to trying local inference first. Safety & Security shield How does Caro's safety validation work? What happens when Caro detects a dangerous command? Caro shows a clear warning explaining why the command is dangerous and what it would do. You can still proceed if you intend to run it—Caro is a seatbelt, not a straitjacket. For truly destructive commands, you'll need to explicitly confirm. Does Caro send my data to the cloud? No. Caro runs 100% locally by default. Your commands, file paths, server names, and directory structures never leave your machine. If you choose to use a cloud backend (like Anthropic or OpenAI), only the natural language prompt is sent—not your command history or file system data. Is Caro safe to use with AI agents? Yes—Caro is designed with AI agents in mind. We recommend defense in depth: run agents as unprivileged users, sandbox to specific directories, use container isolation, and let Caro validate commands. Each layer catches what others miss. How does Caro stay updated with new dangerous patterns? Safety patterns are baked into the binary. When you update Caro (cargo install caro --force), you get the latest patterns. The core dangerous commands don't change. We also accept pattern contributions via GitHub. Backends & Models What LLM backends does Caro support? Which backend should I use? For privacy and offline use, choose local backends. On Apple Silicon Macs, MLX offers the best performance with hardware acceleration. Ollama is great cross-platform. For best quality responses, cloud backends like Claude typically perform better but require API keys. How do I set up Ollama with Caro? How do I use MLX on my Mac? Can I use my own fine-tuned models? Usage & Features terminal How do I use Caro? Can Caro execute commands automatically? How does Caro handle different shells? Caro detects your shell ($SHELL) at runtime and generates appropriate syntax. It works with bash, zsh, fish, and POSIX sh. On macOS, it knows you're using BSD tools; on Linux, it adjusts for GNU syntax. Can I use Caro in scripts? How do I configure Caro? wrench Caro says 'no backend available'—what do I do? Commands are generating slowly—how do I speed things up? Local inference speed depends on your hardware and model size. Try a smaller model (7B instead of 70B), use MLX on Apple Silicon for acceleration, or switch to a cloud backend for faster responses. The generated command is wrong—what should I do? How do I report a bug or request a feature? Privacy & Telemetry What data does Caro collect? Can I disable telemetry? Is Caro GDPR compliant? Yes. We don't collect personal data. All telemetry is anonymous and aggregated. You have full control over what data is sent (if any), and can disable telemetry entirely. Contributing & Community users How can I contribute to Caro? Is Caro open source? How can I support Caro's development?

networking shortcuts try caro explore features glossary - terminal & unix terms explained | caro terminal galore the friendly terminal glossary unix & shell concepts made simple whether you're just starting your terminal journey or brushing up on fundamentals, this glossary breaks down commands, concepts, and caro features into easy-to-digest bites. terminal knowledge for everyone. caro shell basics files & dirs text processing permissions processes networking shortcuts 🥕 caro terms understanding your ai shell companion caro core your ai-powered shell command assistant. caro translates natural language into safe, executable shell commands. think of it as having a unix expert by your side. safety validation safety caro's built-in protection that analyzes commands before execution. it catches dangerous patterns like and asks for confirmation on risky operations. backend config the ai engine powering caro's language understanding. options include local models (ollama, mlx) for privacy or cloud apis (claude, openai) for power. dry run safety preview mode that shows what a command would do without actually executing it. perfect for learning or verifying complex operations. interactive mode feature a conversational shell session where you can ask follow-up questions, refine commands, and explore options naturally. local inference privacy running ai models directly on your machine. your commands and data never leave your computer—perfect for sensitive work environments. 🐚 shell basics the foundation of command-line mastery shell essential the program that interprets your commands. common shells include bash , zsh , and fish . it's the interface between you and the operating system. terminal essential the window application that displays your shell. examples: terminal.app, iterm2, windows terminal, or alacritty. the terminal is the container; the shell runs inside it. cli acronym command line interface . any program you interact with by typing commands rather than clicking. git, npm, docker—all clis. posix standard portable operating system interface . a set of standards ensuring commands work consistently across unix-like systems (linux, macos, bsd). prompt ui the text that appears before your cursor, indicating the shell is ready for input. often shows username, hostname, and current directory: path environment an environment variable listing directories where the shell looks for executable programs. when you type , the shell searches path to find it. environment variable concept named values available to all programs. used for configuration like api keys, paths, and preferences. access with . alias shortcut a custom shortcut for a longer command. define frequently used commands once, use a short name forever. 📁 files & directories navigate and manage your filesystem ls command list directory contents. the first command everyone learns. list all files with details cd command change directory . navigate between folders. go to documents folder pwd command print working directory . shows your current location. output: /home/user/projects mkdir command make directory . create new folders. create nested directories rm command remove . delete files or directories. use with caution! delete with confirmation cp command copy . duplicate files or directories. copy directory recursively mv command move . relocate or rename files/directories. rename a file touch command create empty files or update timestamps. create empty file find command search for files by name, type, size, date, and more. find all javascript files 💡 pro tip: use for home directory, for current, for parent, and for previous directory. 📝 text processing search, filter, and transform text like a pro cat command concatenate . display file contents or combine multiple files. show file contents grep command global regular expression print . search text using patterns. one of the most powerful unix tools. find all todos in source code sed command stream editor . find and replace text, or transform streams with powerful pattern matching. replace all occurrences awk command a complete text-processing language. extract columns, compute values, and format output from structured data. print first column head / tail command view the beginning or end of files. great for logs and large files. follow log in real-time sort / uniq command sort lines and filter duplicates. often used together in pipelines. count unique lines wc command word count . count lines, words, and bytes in files. count lines in all text files pipe ( | ) operator connect commands together. output of one command becomes input to the next. the secret sauce of unix philosophy. count error lines in log 🔐 permissions & ownership control who can do what with your files chmod command change mode . modify file permissions (read, write, execute) for owner, group, and others. make script executable chown command change owner . transfer file ownership to another user or group. change owner and group sudo command superuser do . run commands with administrator privileges. with great power comes great responsibility. update as administrator permission numbers concept octal notation for permissions: 4 =read, 2 =write, 1 =execute. combine for each group (owner/group/others). rwxr-xr-x (owner all, others read+execute) quick permission reference 777 everyone can do everything (rarely safe) 755 owner all, others read & execute (executables) 644 owner read & write, others read (files) 600 owner only read & write (private files) ⚙️ processes & jobs manage running programs and background tasks ps command process status . list running processes and their details. find all node.js processes top / htop command real-time process monitor. see cpu, memory usage, and manage processes interactively. htop is the colorful modern version. kill command send signals to processes. commonly used to terminate misbehaving programs. force kill process 12345 background (&) operator run a command in the background, freeing up your terminal for other work. start server in background ctrl+z / fg / bg shortcuts ctrl+z suspends current process. fg brings it back to foreground. bg resumes it in background. nohup command no hangup . keep process running after you close the terminal. run server persistently 🌐 networking connect, transfer, and debug network operations curl command transfer data from or to a server. the swiss army knife of http requests. send json post request wget command download files from the web. great for fetching resources and mirroring sites. download with custom filename ssh command secure shell . connect to remote machines securely. the backbone of server administration. connect to remote server scp command secure copy . transfer files between machines over ssh. copy file to remote server ping command test network connectivity to a host. sends packets and measures response time. check

No nagging, no degraded features. After beta, telemetry becomes opt-in. We'll ask nicely, but the default is off. Beta is specifically for gathering feedback to improve the product before general availability. Anonymous usage data helps us understand how Caro is used in the real world, identify bugs, and prioritize features. This is standard practice for beta software. At general availability (GA) release, telemetry will be disabled by default. We'll prompt new users to optionally enable it, explaining the value exchange: you help us improve the product, we make Caro better for everyone. No. We use an anonymous session ID that's generated from a hash of your machine ID plus the current date. This means: (1) we can't identify who you are, and (2) the ID rotates daily, so we can't even track the same anonymous user across days. Telemetry is processed by PostHog , a privacy-focused analytics platform. Data is used only for product analytics and is retained for 90 days (raw events) or 2 years (aggregated metrics). You can request deletion by contacting us. No. Caro works identically with or without telemetry. All features, all backends, full performance. We believe in earning telemetry through value, not coercing it through feature gates. Yes! Disable telemetry and use Caro with complete confidence. Nothing is sent anywhere.

Beta is specifically for gathering feedback to improve the product before general availability. Anonymous usage data helps us understand how Caro is used in the real world, identify bugs, and prioritize features. This is standard practice for beta software. When will telemetry become opt-in? At general availability (GA) release, telemetry will be disabled by default. We'll prompt new users to optionally enable it, explaining the value exchange: you help us improve the product, we make Caro better for everyone. Can you identify me from the telemetry data? No. We use an anonymous session ID that's generated from a hash of your machine ID plus the current date. This means: (1) we can't identify who you are, and (2) the ID rotates daily, so we can't even track the same anonymous user across days. What happens to my data? Telemetry is processed by PostHog , a privacy-focused analytics platform. Data is used only for product analytics and is retained for 90 days (raw events) or 2 years (aggregated metrics). You can request deletion by contacting us. Does disabling telemetry affect functionality? No. Caro works identically with or without telemetry. All features, all backends, full performance. We believe in earning telemetry through value, not coercing it through feature gates. I work in a regulated environment. Can I still use Caro? Yes! Disable telemetry and use Caro with complete confidence. Nothing is sent anywhere. All inference happens locally. You can audit the source code—it's AGPL-3.0 licensed. Questions?
