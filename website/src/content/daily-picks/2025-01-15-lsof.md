# Command of the Day: lsof

**The Problem**: "Error: Address already in use"

**The Solution**:
```bash
lsof -i :8080
```

This shows you exactly which process is using port 8080. Kill it, restart your server, and get back to coding.

## Quick Tips

- Use `lsof -i :PORT` for any port
- Add `-P` to show port numbers instead of service names
- Combine with `kill`: `lsof -ti :8080 | xargs kill -9`

## Pro Move

```bash
# Find ALL listening ports
lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
```
