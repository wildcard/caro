# Reverse History Search

Stop scrolling through history with the up arrow. There's a faster way.

## The Magic Keys

Press `Ctrl+R` and start typing. Your shell searches backwards through history for matching commands.

```
(reverse-i-search)`docker': docker compose up -d
```

## Quick Actions

- **Ctrl+R**: Search backwards
- **Ctrl+G**: Cancel search
- **Enter**: Run the found command
- **Right Arrow**: Edit the command first
- **Ctrl+R again**: Find older matches

## Pro Mode

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export HISTSIZE=10000
export HISTFILESIZE=20000
export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups:erasedups
```

Bigger history + no duplicates = faster searching.
