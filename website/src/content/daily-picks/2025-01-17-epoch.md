Why 1970? The original Unix was written in 1969-1971, so they picked a round number close to the beginning.

`date +%s` shows the current Unix timestamp.

# The Unix Epoch

Every Unix system counts time the same way: seconds since **January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC**.

## Why 1970?

When Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie were building Unix in 1969-1971, they needed a starting point for their time system. They chose January 1, 1970, because:

1. It was a nice round number
2. Close to when Unix was born
3. Far enough back to handle "old" files

## Check It Yourself

```bash
# Current Unix timestamp
date +%s

# Convert timestamp to human-readable
date -d @1704067200

# Difference between two dates in seconds
echo $(($(date +%s) - $(date -d "2024-01-01" +%s)))
```

## The Y2K38 Problem

32-bit Unix timestamps will overflow on **January 19, 2038** at 03:14:07 UTC. That's why 64-bit systems matter!

```bash
# Max 32-bit timestamp
date -d @2147483647
# Tue Jan 19 03:14:07 UTC 2038
```
