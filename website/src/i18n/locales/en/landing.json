          "question": "Wait, Caro runs locally. How does it stay updated with new dangerous patterns?",
          "answer": "Caro's safety patterns are baked into the binary—no network needed. When you update Caro (cargo install caro --force), you get the latest patterns. The core dangerous commands (rm -rf /, fork bombs, disk wipers) don't change. We also accept pattern contributions via GitHub.",

        {
          "question": "Will this slow down my incident response?",
          "answer": "No. Caro adds <100ms to command generation. The safety check is instant (pattern matching, not AI inference). In a real incident, that's 100ms that might save you from making things 10x worse. The validation is synchronous—you see the warning immediately.",

        },
        {
          "question": "How does it know my specific system setup (BSD vs GNU, etc.)?",
          "answer": "Caro detects your OS and shell at runtime. On macOS, it knows you're using BSD tools. On Linux, it adjusts for GNU syntax. It reads your $SHELL and adjusts accordingly. No configuration needed—it just works.",
          "icon": "🖥️"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if I actually NEED to run a dangerous command?",
          "answer": "Caro warns, it doesn't jail. When you see a warning, you can still proceed—we just make sure you're doing it intentionally. For truly destructive commands (rm -rf /), you'll need to confirm. This is your seatbelt, not a straitjacket.",
          "icon": "🔓"
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this just another AI wrapper that sends my commands to the cloud?",
          "answer": "No. Caro runs 100% locally. Your commands, file paths, server names, and directory structures never leave your machine. The inference happens on your hardware. We have zero telemetry. Check the source code—it's AGPL-3.0 licensed.",
          "icon": "🔒"
        },
        {
          "question": "Why should I trust AI-generated shell commands at all?",
          "answer": "You shouldn't trust them blindly—that's the point. Caro generates commands AND validates them before you run them. It's not 'trust the AI'—it's 'trust the pattern-based safety layer that catches what the AI might get wrong.' The validation is deterministic, not probabilistic.",
