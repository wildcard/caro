# Security Practices

## Safety Validation: 52+ Dangerous Patterns

One of the core principles of Caro's security practices is ensuring all code blocks and patterns utilized in development pipelines are vetted rigorously. For example, in our repository, we include extensive validation steps for potentially hazardous patterns.

Take the **fork bomb** example `:(){ :|:& };:`. It's a compact yet destructive string whose misuse can lead to infinite process creation. Interestingly, its inclusion in our documentation once caused our Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to fail spectacularly. The Astro parser, encountering this unescaped text, misinterpreted part of the syntax as JavaScript code, throwing unexpected and confusing errors. 

This experience, while humorous in hindsight, highlighted how even well-known examples like the fork bomb could disrupt automated systems. It underscored the importance of escaping and auditing all input rigorously, especially when dealing with interpreters or parsers as part of automated pipelines.

Caro has since implemented additional validation layers specifically to handle such edge cases. We use this anecdote to reinforce that robust security checks are not just theoretical—they're essential in real-world development environments.
