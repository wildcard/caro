### Fork Bomb Deployment Error Anecdote

While creating this blog post to highlight Caro's security practices, an unexpected issue arose. Including a fork bomb example (`:(){ :|:& };:`)—a known hazardous shell command—caused our CI/CD to fail during deployment. The Astro parser, mistaking this snippet for JavaScript syntax, returned parsing errors that halted the site build. This incident emphasized how even controlled examples can trigger system vulnerabilities, reinforcing the imperative for escaping and validating all potentially risky content.

This lesson fed directly into our ongoing commitment to security-first development. Curious readers can see the resolving PR [fixing this issue](https://github.com/wildcard/caro/pull/99).
