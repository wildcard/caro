# Security Practices at Caro

Ensuring the security and reliability of our platform is at the core of our operations at Caro. As we continually update and enhance our systems, we sometimes encounter challenges that help us learn and grow.

One such learning moment arose from an incident involving a "fork bomb" deployment error. Essentially, an oversight allowed a recursive shell script to propagate unscheduled processes, flooding our system resources and causing temporary disruption. This experience served as a valuable lesson in establishing safeguards to detect and prevent such anomalies from making it into production. For technical details, please refer to our resolution documented in [PR #99](https://github.com/wildcard/caro/pull/99).

## Our Approach to Security

1. **Code Reviews**: Every line of code goes through a stringent review process to ensure compliance with security standards.
2. **Automated Testing and Monitoring**: Our CI/CD pipeline includes a suite of automated tests, and we employ monitoring solutions to prevent, detect, and mitigate any incidents.
3. **Training and Awareness**: Our teams undergo periodic training to stay updated with the best practices in software and operational security.

In the ever-evolving technological landscape, security is not just a goal but an ongoing process. We are committed to learning from our experiences and ensuring the highest standards to serve our users.
