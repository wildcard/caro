<p>
  Why Caro? What makes Caro so special that she deserves to live forever in your terminal? Why should she be digitized for eternity as a command-line tool that runs alongside you every day? The answer lies in the extraordinary story of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kyaroblackheart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyaro</a>—a very special dog.
</p>

<h2>Born into the World of Tech</h2>

<p>
  Caro is the digitalization of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kyaroblackheart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyaro</a> (Kyarorain Kadosh), a Shiba Inu who has been living and breathing technology from day one. Born in 2020 during the midst of the COVID pandemic, Kyaro came into this world as a tiny puppy destined to become an office dog. She was brought home by what might be Israel's most workaholic software engineer—though perhaps I'm giving myself too much credit.
</p>

</div>

<p>
  From her earliest days, Kyaro was a fixture in the office, visiting multiple days a week. She fell in love with Wix and its office spaces—first at Wix Academy, then at the Tel Aviv port location, later at Namaal, and finally at Wix HQ. But more importantly, she fell in love with the people: the geeks, the developers, the system administrators, and everyone in IT.
</p>

<div class="highlight">
  <p>
    Kyaro was always the most friendly dog when it came to technical people. She follows in her owner's pawprints—I've always liked IT folks too, and my friendship with IT departments across every company I've worked for can attest to that. Same goes for Kyaro: she was universally adored by IT people.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>The Socially Selective Shiba</h2>

<p>
  Here's the funny thing about Kyaro: most dogs are friendly, but she's socially selective. She doesn't warm up to every dog she meets, and she's certainly not interested in playing with just any pup. I always thought she was into every Shiba Inu, mirroring my own appreciation for the breed. But after moving to Canada, I learned the truth—she's not into every dog, not even every Shiba.
</p>

<p>
  Yet when it comes to humans, especially technical people, programmers, and IT professionals—you name it—Kyaro has always loved them. All of them. Every system department at Wix, all the developers, the DBAs especially—nobody liked her more than the database administrators at Wix. She was their best friend, and they were hers.
</p>

<h2>A Life Lived Side-by-Side with Code</h2>

<p>
  When Kyaro wasn't being an office dog, she was always by my side. And what do I do all day, every day? I'm on the computer—developing something, troubleshooting something, building something. She had to cope with that reality, and she did so with grace.
</p>

<p>
  Some might say it's a good life, others might disagree. It's the only life I could give her, and I tried my best. But one thing is certain: Kyaro was universally loved by IT people, sysadmins, front-end engineers, back-end engineers, database administrators—everyone doing software work.
</p>

<blockquote>
  The DBAs at Wix had a special bond with her. I don't know about other workplaces because she only worked with me in the office at Wix. Since 2023, I've been working remotely from Canada, so she hasn't been going to the office much. It's one of the things I'm a bit sad about—she really liked going to the office.
</blockquote>

<p>
  When my spouse was working in the office, we'd take Kyaro along, and she loved it. Everyone there loved her too. I can't speak to whether the IT people at my spouse's office were as smitten with her, but from my experience, she's always had a thing for geeks.
</p>

<h2>The Perfect Terminal Companion</h2>

<p>
  So it's only fitting that she'll be there with developers when they're working side-by-side in their terminals—keeping an eye on them, making sure they're not making mistakes, keeping them safe, giving them sound advice, and fetching those commands.
</p>

<p>
  Here's a fun fact about Shibas: they're not retrievers. You can play fetch with them, but they won't just give it back. You throw it, they might get it, but then you need to work for it. It's part of the logic behind Caro in the terminal—she behaves like a Shiba. She'll put you to some work, and she has Easter eggs you'll discover along the way.
</p>

<div class="highlight">
  <p>
    Give her a try. She's definitely here to help you fetch those models and run inference in Rust, in the fastest way possible. You know she's got the zoomies and just can't wait for you to discover the zoomies in your terminal!
  </p>

<h2>From Kyaro to Caro</h2>

<p>
  This is the story of Kyaro (the IRL Shiba) becoming Caro (the terminal companion). Like <a href="https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Caroline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portal 2's Caroline</a>, who was transformed into GLaDOS to become the eternal guardian of Aperture Science's testing chambers, Kyaro becomes Caro—your eternal companion for the terminal. If you're not familiar with the <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portal series by Valve</a>, it's a story about loyalty, transformation, and eternal companionship that deeply resonates with Caro's journey.
</p>

<p>
  She's not just a tool. She's not just a CLI. She's a companion with a story, with personality, with a lifetime of love for the people who build technology. She's here to keep you safe, help you work faster, and remind you that even in the most technical of work, there's room for loyalty, warmth, and a little bit of that Shiba sass.
</p>

<h2>Why She Belongs in Your Terminal</h2>

<p>
  Caro should be in your terminal because she represents something deeper than just another developer tool. She embodies the spirit of companionship in solitary work, the safety that comes from having someone watching your back, and the joy of working alongside someone who understands you.
</p>

<p>
  Every developer who's ever had a pet nearby while coding knows that feeling—the comfort of a loyal presence, the occasional distraction that's actually welcome, the reminder that there's a world beyond the screen. Caro brings that same energy to your command line.
</p>

<p>
  She's been trained by her life among developers. She knows the patterns, the dangers, the workflows. She's watched countless hours of terminal work, witnessed the mistakes, celebrated the victories. Now, she's ready to be your companion too.
</p>

<div class="highlight">
  <p>
    Welcome to the pack. Caro is here to stay—in your terminal, by your side, keeping you safe and helping you fetch the perfect commands. Just like a good Shiba, she'll make you work for it, but she'll always have your back.
