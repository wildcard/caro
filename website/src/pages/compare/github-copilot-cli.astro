        <p><strong>GitHub Copilot CLI</strong> sends your prompts to GitHub's servers, where they're processed by OpenAI's models. While GitHub has privacy policies in place, your shell commands - including potentially sensitive paths, server names, and operations - traverse the internet.</p>
        <p><strong>Caro</strong> runs entirely on your machine. With local model inference, your commands, prompts, and terminal context never leave your computer. This makes Caro suitable for air-gapped environments, compliance-restricted organizations, and developers who simply prefer to keep their terminal activity private.</p>

        <p><strong>GitHub Copilot CLI</strong> relies on the underlying language model to generate "safe" suggestions. There's no systematic validation layer - the model might or might not catch dangerous patterns like <code>rm -rf /</code>.</p>
        <p><strong>Caro</strong> has 52+ predefined safety patterns that validate every command before presenting it to you. Dangerous operations like recursive deletions, fork bombs, and system-breaking commands are blocked at the validation layer - independent of what the model suggests.</p>

        <p><strong>GitHub Copilot CLI</strong> requires a GitHub Copilot subscription ($10-19/month for individuals, more for enterprises). You're also dependent on GitHub's service availability.</p>
        <p><strong>Caro</strong> is completely free and open source. You run it on your hardware with your own models. No accounts, no subscriptions, no vendor lock-in.</p>

      content: `
        <p><strong>GitHub Copilot CLI</strong> has access to powerful OpenAI models (GPT-4 class) trained on massive datasets. For complex, novel commands, it may produce better suggestions.</p>
        <p><strong>Caro</strong> uses local models which, while improving rapidly, may not match the raw capability of cloud giants. However, for common shell operations (finding files, text processing, system administration), local models are often sufficient - and you get the benefit of privacy and speed.</p>
