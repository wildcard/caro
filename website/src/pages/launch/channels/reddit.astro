          <p class="copy-text" id="devops-body">**The problem I was trying to solve:**

You're SSH'd into a production server at 2am. You need to find all log files modified in the last hour, but you blank on the exact `find` syntax. Your options:

1. Open browser, Google it, navigate Stack Overflow
2. Try to remember if it's `-mtime` or `-mmin` (and what the numbers mean)
3. Read through `man find` (2,847 lines)

I've done all three more times than I'd like to admit.

**What I built:**

[Caro](https://github.com/wildcard/caro) - a CLI that converts natural language to shell commands using local inference.

```
$ caro "find log files modified in the last hour"
→ find /var/log -name "*.log" -mmin -60

Execute? [y/N]
```

**Key design decisions:**

- **Local-first**: Model runs on your machine. No cloud API, no telemetry, no command history leaving your system.
- **Explicit confirmation**: Nothing executes without you typing `y`. Ever.
- **Rule-based safety**: 52 regex patterns validate commands before they reach your terminal. Even if the model suggests `rm -rf /`, it gets blocked.
- **Offline capable**: Works on air-gapped networks, planes, wherever.

**What it's NOT:**

- A replacement for knowing shell commands (power users will always be faster)
- A general AI coding assistant (very focused on shell commands specifically)
- Production-ready (alpha software, rough edges exist)

**Tech stack:** Rust, MLX (Apple Silicon) / Candle (CPU), AGPL-3.0

**Why I'm posting:**

Looking for feedback from people who actually live in terminals. What's missing? What would make this useful for your workflow?

I built something to help with those moments.

**What it does:**

Natural language → shell command → explicit confirmation → execute

```
$ caro "recursively find files larger than 100MB"
→ find . -type f -size +100M

Execute? [y/N]
```

**Key point: It's 100% local**

- No cloud API
- No telemetry
- No data collection
- Works offline

Your command history stays on your machine.

**Safety approach:**

I don't trust AI to be safe on its own. So:

1. 52 pre-compiled regex patterns catch dangerous operations
2. Every command requires explicit confirmation
3. Risk levels: Safe → Moderate → High → CRITICAL (blocked)

Even if the model hallucinates `rm -rf /`, the safety layer blocks it.

**Honest limitations:**

- Local models are less capable than cloud (tradeoff for privacy)
- Focused on POSIX utilities (not obscure tools)
- Alpha software (rough edges)

Written in Rust, uses MLX on Apple Silicon, Candle for CPU.

Interested in feedback from CLI power users. What patterns would you add to the safety list? What commands do you always forget?</p>

        <div class="post-body">
          <p class="copy-text" id="rust-body">I've been building a CLI tool that converts natural language to shell commands using local LLM inference. Wanted to share the Rust-specific technical choices.

**Architecture:**

- **CLI**: `clap` for argument parsing
- **Inference backends**: Trait-based system supporting multiple providers
  - MLX (Apple Silicon, via FFI)
  - Candle (cross-platform CPU)
  - Remote options (Ollama, vLLM) for larger models
- **Safety validation**: 52 pre-compiled regex patterns for dangerous command detection
- **Async runtime**: Tokio for backend communication

**Interesting challenges:**

1. **FFI with MLX**: Using `cxx` crate for safe C++ interop with Apple's MLX framework. Unified memory architecture on Apple Silicon makes this particularly efficient.

2. **Regex performance**: Safety patterns are compiled once at startup. Had to balance pattern comprehensiveness with compilation time.

3. **JSON parsing fallbacks**: LLMs aren't always reliable with structured output. Built a fallback chain: strict JSON → relaxed parsing → regex extraction.

4. **Platform detection**: BSD vs GNU differences (especially `sed`, `find` flags) required runtime detection for appropriate suggestions.

**Crate choices:**

- `serde` + `serde_json` for config/response handling
- `reqwest` for HTTP backends
- `directories` for cross-platform cache management
- `colored` for terminal output
- `anyhow` for error handling

**What I learned:**

The trait system made adding new backends straightforward. Each backend implements `ModelBackend` with async inference and availability checking.

Error handling philosophy: Use `Result` everywhere, no panics in production code. Every failure mode should have a helpful message.

Still alpha—would appreciate feedback on the Rust patterns, especially the FFI approach and error handling.</p>

          <p class="copy-text" id="selfhosted-body">Built this because I wanted AI-assisted shell commands without sending my command history to Microsoft/OpenAI.

**What it does:**

Describe what you want in plain English → get the shell command → review → execute

```
$ caro "compress this directory excluding node_modules"
→ tar --exclude='node_modules' -czvf archive.tar.gz .

Execute? [y/N]
```

**Self-hosting benefits:**

- **Zero cloud dependencies**: Everything runs locally
- **No telemetry**: Not even "anonymous" usage data
- **Works offline**: Air-gapped networks, no internet required
- **Your data stays yours**: Command history never leaves your machine

**Requirements:**

- ~3GB disk for model weights (cached in ~/.cache/caro)
- Apple Silicon recommended (MLX backend), but CPU works too (Candle)
- Or connect to your own Ollama/vLLM instance for larger models

**Installation:**

```bash
# macOS
brew install caro

# From source
cargo install caro
```

**Tradeoffs (being honest):**

- Smaller local models = less capable than GPT-4
- First inference downloads model weights
- Alpha software, not production-ready

```
$ caro "find files owned by apache user"
→ find /var/www -user apache

Execute? [y/N]
```

**Why I'm sharing here:**

1. **Works on servers**: Doesn't require a GUI or browser. Pure CLI.
2. **Offline**: Air-gapped servers, bastion hosts, wherever you need it.
3. **Nothing phones home**: No analytics, no telemetry, no cloud API.

**What this is NOT:**

- A replacement for knowing your commands (power users are faster)
- Smarter than GPT-4 (local models have limits)
- Production-ready (alpha software)

**Safety stuff:**

Everything requires explicit confirmation. Plus 52 regex patterns that block obviously dangerous operations regardless of what the model suggests.

I'm not claiming it's foolproof. But it won't run `rm -rf /` just because an LLM had a moment.

**Tech:**
- Rust binary
- Uses MLX on Mac, Candle on Linux
- AGPL-3.0 open source

Feedback welcome, especially on what commands sysadmins actually forget. What patterns should be added to the safety list?

For shell command syntax specifically, smaller models work surprisingly well. The domain is constrained: POSIX utilities, known flags, predictable patterns.

Where it breaks: complex multi-step pipelines, obscure tools, context-dependent logic. For those, we support connecting to larger models via Ollama or vLLM.

2. We don't trust the model's safety claims either. 52 regex patterns validate independently.
3. It's open source - you can audit exactly what it does.

2. **Shell commands only** - not a general AI assistant, just this one thing
3. **Rule-based safety** - regex patterns that work independently of the model
